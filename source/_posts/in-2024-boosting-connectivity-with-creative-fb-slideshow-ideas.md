## Part 3: Tips for Optimizing Your Slideshow Video for Facebook

Everyone can create a slideshow but not everyone can create appealing slideshows. This sentence creates a big difference. So, if you want to create a high-quality slideshow, then it is good to follow a few professional tips and [Facebook also has offered a few tips FYI](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/347114248961706).

      * The key behind a good slideshow creation process is to keep it as short as you can. Facebook users often feel annoyed with long posts and they never rate them better. In order to make an attention grabber videos or slideshows always try to keep them shorter.
      * The selection of photos for the slideshow really matters a lot but the selection of the first photo demands the major focus. How your slideshow appears in the first two-three seconds; is going to make a real difference in its popularity. At least it must capture the attention of viewers and should compel them to watch it till the end.
      * Never forget to use captions and titles for your slideshow stories as they add an engaging impact.
