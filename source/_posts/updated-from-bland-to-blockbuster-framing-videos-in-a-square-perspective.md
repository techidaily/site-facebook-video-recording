With a high video consumption rate, Facebook is dominating the top spots in video consumption platforms across the internet. Though, it includes both landscape and square videos, being an influencer you must figure out whether square videos on Facebook or landscapes fare better.

No doubt both the varieties have their own space in Facebook, but you can always pick the square videos to have an upper hand. In case you are unsure about how to create square videos on Facebook, we are happy to help you.

* [**Part2: What you should consider when you create a video**](#part2)
* [**Part2: How to create square videos by Filmora**](#part3)
* [**Part2: How to create square videos by Adobe Premiere**](#part4)

## Part 1: Why you should choose square videos

Do you have any idea about when should you go square for Facebook videos? These videos occupy around [78% extra space of the mobile feed or News feed](https://www.adweek.com/digital/instagrams-box-shaped-videos-are-influencing-facebook-marketers-172490/)than landscape ones which makes it an ultimate choice for Instagram and Facebook videos.

According to the social media management application Buffer, [square videos and letterbox videos (1:1) format scored better](https://blog.bufferapp.com/square-video-vs-landscape-video) in recent ads over social media accounts. The average views, engagements, and completion rate on mobile devices yielded the said result.

You need to opt for square videos, while creating a video for social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter. For mobile phone viewers, square videos on Facebook will engross more space and be prominently visible.

## Part 2: What you should consider when you create a video

[Here are the aspects](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/video/facebook-feed/video-views) that you need to keep in mind, while creating square videos on Facebook. Avoid black bars/letter or pillar boxing and upload a high resolution video of at least  compression, square pixels, with progressive scan, fixed frame rate and 128+ kbps stereo audio compression.

Here are the facts and figures –

* 9:16 to 16:9 video ratio.
* High resolution video with appropriate ratio and size constraints.
* Minimum 1 second to maximum 240 minutes long video.
* Maximum 4GB file size.
* 125 characters text
* Vertical videos having 2:3 aspect ratio which might be masked to 2:3.

If the video has links, a 25 characters’ link and 30 characters’ link description is what you need. If you post 360 videos, the aspect ratio tolerance needs to be 3%.
