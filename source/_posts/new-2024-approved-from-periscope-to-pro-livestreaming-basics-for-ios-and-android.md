## Notes and tips

 1\. You need to keep in mind that the maximum time limit for broadcasting on Facebook is 30 minutes.

 2\. If you get trolled by other users while broadcasting or you don’t like the comments from a viewer then you can choose to block them from the broadcast. Just click on their profile pic which appears beside their comment and hit **‘Block’**.

 3\. Before you go live on Facebook make sure that you have fast connection. Wi-fi works best for live broadcast on Facebook. If you don’t have wifi access then try using a 4G connection. Ideally you should check the speed of your net before you start broadcasting. For this you need to go to Google Play or App Store and download the Speedtest application.

 4\. Once the broadcast is done the video is going to appear on your Facebook profile page and can be seen by your selected audience. However you can choose to remove the video at any time if your want.
