You might have seen so many videos that contain captions and assist users to understand content with ease even if audio is turned off. Such types of videos are common on Facebook as well as on Facebook Live Streaming app. You will be glad to know that Facebook has recently launched an advanced automatic captioning tool for Facebook Pages in US and it works for free. But this feature is not yet added to Facebook Profiles, reason being the Facebook pages and profiles use follow large number of feature based differences. If you love to stream videos so often on Facebook Pages then probably you must be searching hard for the caption and subtitle creation option as it allows easy customization. Don’t worry! The article below can provide you complete information to add captions on your Facebook videos:

## How to Create Subtitles and Captions for Facebook Video

Step 2: Now use edit video button it will help you to reach at Captions Tab. It offers two selections: Generate or Upload SRT file.

#### Upload SRT File option

The great news for adding video captions is that this platform supports various languages. Users can upload captions manually using their desired language. If you want to add captions from SRT file then simply use Upload SRT file option available on screen and get it uploaded from your computer. And then click the Save button.

SRT caption files are usually supported by almost all popular media players and they can be generated by users with the help of standard text editor tools like Notepad++ or MAC OS users can switch to TextEdit option. Follow the steps below to get started:

* Simple open your desired Text editor tool.
* Note that, each caption phrase need to be divided into several numbered sections so start with 1 and then press Enter.
* The standard timing options for SubRip formats use to be milliseconds so you need to divide all phrases respectively into desired time slots. Keep on adding your phrases till the time you cover whole video.

* Now save this text file into SRT format by using Save and then All Files option. Add your desired file name and select file format as .srt. Hit Save option.
* Note: Facebook can't recognize your caption file unless it is named in the format: \[two-letter language code\]\_\[two-letter contury code\].srt.

#### Generate Captions

For this case, all you need to do is select the Generate option from tool and captions will be automatically added in US English language format.
