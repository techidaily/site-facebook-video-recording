## Part 1: All You Need to Know About Facebook Messenger

The world of instant messaging has transformed since the advent of Messenger. In August, 2011 the facebook chat was replaced by Messenger but you can use Messenger even when you don’t have a facebook account. The app can be used on web, desktop and mobile apps, including Android and Apple, which makes it compatible with the Apple watch.

Essentially, Messenger is a texting app that allows you to text a person one-on-one or chat in a group. Upon all that messenger allows you to use emojis that reflect your emotions. But, the best part is how you can easily share videos, pictures and documents in Messenger.

Facebook Messenger comes with an array of great features including reacting on messages and media, read receipts, time stamps on messages, customizing your chat style etc.

Amongst all the fantastic features of Facebook Messenger, it collects all the media files you share in a chat and stores them in a single folder. This allows you to quickly view all the files that you have shared in a chat. This is what makes this app a fan favorite.

For all those unfamiliar with the last feature, we will guide you in detail on how you can access photos and videos in your messenger chat.

## Part 2: How Can You View All Photos And Videos on Desktop App

One always faces some kind of trouble when we are navigating another version of the same app. The case gets particularly sensitive when some essential or memorable pictures and videos are involved.

We all love chatting on the messenger app, but sometimes it is impossible to find all the media that you shared in the chatbox. The images and videos are often lost in between with all the text messages.

Messenger has just the solution to that, and we are here to guide you. If you own the messenger desktop app, then follow the steps below:

1. Open the Messenger app on your Desktop.
2. Select the contact you want to access the media of.
3. Next, when the chatbox for that contact opens, click on the three dots in the upper right corner.
4. Select Video Media and Files.

Here you can view all the media files that are arranged according to their date.

And, you are done. You can now use the above steps to access multimedia in any chat.

## Finding Photos And Videos on Messenger Website

While the Desktop app is excellent to use when you are not using messenger on your phone, most of us just go to the messenger site and chat away. Sometimes it’s just easier to chat on your browser and not open any apps.

But, do not worry if you find it challenging to navigate the messenger website just because it is your first time or you don’t know anything about it besides how to chat. We can help you with that, especially if you can not locate pictures and videos through the website. Follow the easy and simple steps below, and you will find the media files in no time.

1. Open your messenger app and log in with your user ID and password.
2. Click on the names of your friends on your left to open a chatbox.
3. When you open the conversation, click on the three small dots on the top right corner to open the information about a conversation.
4. Then click on **Shared Media**to access all the pictures and videos that you have sent to this particular contact.

![click on Shared Media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/view-all-shared-videos-and-photos-on-messenger-1.png)

You can do that with any contact. This way, you will be able to see videos and photos even when you have misplaced them on the phone. You can forward them to other contacts from there as well.
