![use menu to look for live videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-6.png)

**Step 5: Searching For Specific Live Streams**

Sometimes you want to watch content from specific creators or channels. This means you might need to look for their streams in particular. If you don't have any time to lose, this option is perfect.

![use magnifying glass to search for videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-7.png)

Simply look for the magnifying glass icon on the top left-hand side. You can enter the relevant search terms and press enter/return key. Filter the search by hitting on the switch next to the live video. This will take you to the live stream you want to watch. If you want to watch live streams that just ended, you can. Look for videos without the red 'Live' tab on the top left corner.

**Step 6: Communicate on Chat**

You can communicate on chat quite easily. You may need to be logged in to your Facebook account for this function. The chats are visible on the right-hand side of the live stream. Sometimes, you'll see instructions from the creator. These are guidelines for interactions. These guidelines can help you stay engaged with the community around your favorite celebrity, influencer, and more.

**Step 7: Close the Live Video**

You can check out of a live stream by selecting the 'x' button to close the stream. This will close the live stream page. You'll be back on the 'Watch' page.

## Part 2\. How Do I Watch Facebook Live on Android?

The process of watching a live video on your android phone is similar. It's different enough for these steps. Let's use the guiding principles below to watch Facebook live with friends on Android.

**Step 1: Open the Facebook app.**

You can look for the Facebook icon. It's a blue circle with the small letter 'f' in white. Again, if you're viewing live streams on mobile, you can use [www.facebook.com/watch/live/](http://www.facebook.com/watch/live/) on your browser. You can also paste the live video URL into the browser and go directly to watch the video.

![find the facebook app on android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-9.png)

**Step 2: Select 'Watch'**

The watch icon is available from a row of icons at the top of your phone's screen. The watch icon looks like a small TV. Select the TV icon to watch live stream videos and edited videos.

![use watch icon to find videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-10.png)

**Step 3: Find Live Tab**

Below the 'Watch' tab, you will see a series of labels. With tags like 'For You,' 'Live,' Music,' and more. Select 'Live' from this list. The 'Watch' tab lets you view live videos only. If you need to find a live video that has finished broadcasting, use the next option.

![use live tab to find live videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-11.png)

**Step 4: Search for Live Videos**

If you know the name of the live video you want to watch, then you can find it easily. Simply tap on the magnifying glass icon. This icon will search Facebook for the video specified. This function also pulls up videos that have finished broadcasting as well.

## Part 3\. How Can I Find Facebook Live on iPhone

**Step 1: Open the Facebook app**

You can log into the Facebook app. iPhones also support your ability to view live streams on browsers. You can watch the live on your mobile browser. However, you won't be able to interact with the video.

**Step 2: Find the Menu**
