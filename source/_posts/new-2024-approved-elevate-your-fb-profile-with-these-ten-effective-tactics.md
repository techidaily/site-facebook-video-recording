### 1. Optimize Facebook Content

 Speaking of SEO for Facebook page, though, it might not have a direct impact on social media content and popup results for your keyword search on Google. You need to mention the social media platform name in Google search to get the results. Your content will be easily discoverable by users when you [optimize social media content using keywords](https://www.wordstream.com/articles/keyword-research-for-social-media-guide). Links and public posts using those keywords will show up on the search results.

 People click and engage with your content if it’s relevant to them and included in the keywords, and spend more time on your site.

### 2. Optimize Page URL

 For Facebook SEO, you need to have a [custom URL same as your brand name](https://www.weebly.com/seo/url). It eventually promotes brand recognition and makes users remember your brand. Unless you create a custom URL for your Facebook page, Facebook might auto-generate a long and tough to memorize URL. Using ‘Page Info’ under your Facebook page’s ‘About’ section, access the ‘Create Page @username’ and create the username. Set the brand name in place of username and you are good to go.

### 3. Optimize company profile

 While doing SEO for Facebook page, not every brand optimizes their company profile online. But, it is crucial to optimize and encourage growth of the Facebook fan page for their brands. When you add phone numbers and address on your business page, Google gives more credibility to your page. As a result, your brand’s overall SEO will be enhanced.
