![use menu to look for live videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-6.png)

**Step 5: Searching For Specific Live Streams**

Sometimes you want to watch content from specific creators or channels. This means you might need to look for their streams in particular. If you don't have any time to lose, this option is perfect.

![use magnifying glass to search for videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-7.png)

Simply look for the magnifying glass icon on the top left-hand side. You can enter the relevant search terms and press enter/return key. Filter the search by hitting on the switch next to the live video. This will take you to the live stream you want to watch. If you want to watch live streams that just ended, you can. Look for videos without the red 'Live' tab on the top left corner.

**Step 6: Communicate on Chat**

You can communicate on chat quite easily. You may need to be logged in to your Facebook account for this function. The chats are visible on the right-hand side of the live stream. Sometimes, you'll see instructions from the creator. These are guidelines for interactions. These guidelines can help you stay engaged with the community around your favorite celebrity, influencer, and more.

**Step 7: Close the Live Video**

You can check out of a live stream by selecting the 'x' button to close the stream. This will close the live stream page. You'll be back on the 'Watch' page.

You can also paste the live video URL into the browser and go directly to watch the video.
