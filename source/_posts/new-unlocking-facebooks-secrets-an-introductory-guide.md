## Part 3: How to Use Facebook Insights for Beginners

### 1\. Overview

 What is overview all about? The overview gives you a complete picture of your and your audience’s activities on your page for a week. The prime things that it covers are how many likes, comments, and shares your post received over a week, the number of people who viewed your content for one week, and the number of likes your page received. By understanding the measurement and performance of your page, you can check if any sort of pattern is developing, and then, delve deeper into the sections.

![insights overview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/insights-overview.JPG)

### 2\. Page Likes

 There are three basic metrics in the likes section.

 Firstly, the **page likes**, which captures the total likes on your page per day for 28 days.

 Secondly, the **net likes**, which captures the total new likes on your page subtracted by the total dislikes.

 Finally, the **certain times** your page was liked but broken by where it took place. In order to build your brand, you need to keep a track of your page likes and make sure that you are targeting the right people and connecting with them by targeting posts through relevant content.

### 3\. Post Reach

 The Post Reach helps you to understand how many people viewed your posts and how they interacted or responded to it. It is divided into 4 prime metrics. The Post Reach shows you the number of people who were exposed to a particular post. It is further broken into paid and organic reach.

**Total Reach** shows the total number of people who viewed any kind of activities from your page.

 In Like Comments, and Share section, you can check the total number of shares, comments, and likes and the positive engagement your page received. Your post will be shown to more people according to the higher number of engagement in your post.

 In Hide, Report as Spam, and Unlikes, you may check the negative people count on your page. When the negative engagement of the people is more, lesser people can view your post in future.
