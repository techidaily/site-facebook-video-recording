### 3. How does Facebook Story Look Like?

![How Facebook Story Look Like?](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-facebook-story-look-like.jpg)

When you share content via a Facebook story, it does not appear in your News Feed. Instead, it appears at the top of the Facebook News Feed in the app and the desktop version. Your stories are visible to your selected audience for 24 hours only. Any photo or video you add to your Facebook story will also appear in your story on Messenger.

### 4. How does Facebook Story Work?

If you are looking for how to use Facebook story, then let us tell you that Facebook stories work similarly to Instagram stories. They appear at the top of your News Feed. To view someone’s Facebook story, tap on the profile picture circle. While viewing a story, you can respond with a direct message.

When you open a Facebook story, it appears on full screen. You can tap the left or ride side of the screen to skip backward or forward. Unseen stories have a blue ring around them, and the viewed ones are grey. If you do not wish to see a certain user’s stories, you can mute them, and they will not show up on your Story feed. To mute a user, click on their story, then tap on the three dots at the top right corner, and click on mute to hide the stories.

### 5. What are the Differences Between Facebook Story and Facebook Feed?

Facebook offers two options for users to share their views, pictures, and videos, the News Feed, and Stories. However, many people are confused and wonder about the difference between the two.

News Feed is the core functionality of Facebook and has been a part of it since the beginning. When you post an update here using the “What’s on your mind” box, it appears on your wall/timeline. To find new content, you need o scroll down.

On the other hand, Stories is a feature introduced a few years ago. When you add content like the photos or videos here, it shows as a slideshow. The option is like a catalog, when you finish watching one story, the next story starts playing automatically.

## Part 2: How to Post to Facebook Story on PC?

You can easily post to the Facebook story using your PC, although the features are limited. Here are some simple steps to follow.

Step 1 – Login to your Facebook on a web browser, and at the top of the News Feed, you see Create Story with your profile picture.

Step 2 – Tap on the + button, and you get two options, Create a Photo Story and Create a Text Story.

![Create Facebook Story  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-facebook-story.jpg)

Step 3 – Select the one you want. If you choose the photo story, it asks you to upload the photos/videos from your computer. Choose the photo you want to post as a story, and in the preview window, you can crop and rotate it. You can also add the text if you want and then click on Share to Story.

![Create Facebook text Story  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-facebook-text-story.jpg)

If you choose a text story, you can type whatever is on your mind, choose the font style, add background color, and then Share to Story.

See how easy it is to post to the Facebook story using PC.

You can share both photos and videos to your Facebook story using the PC

## Part 3: How to Post to Story on Facebook Mobile App?

Posting to story on the Facebook mobile app is simple. However, the process is a bit different than posting from a PC. Follow the steps here to post a Facebook story on mobile.

Step 1 – Open your Facebook app and at the top of your News Feed click on Create Story.

Step 2 – Choose the type of story you want from Text, Music, B612 Camera, Boomerang, Selfie, Poll, and Mood. You can also choose photos or videos from your mobile.

![Create Facebook   Story on mobile  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-facebook-story-mobile.jpg)

Step 3 – Enhance your story with stickers, text, effects, music, and animation.

Step 4 – Once done with the editing, click on Share.

The effects found on the Facebook story are like Instagram stories. You can add emojis and sticker icons and add filters to a photo and video clip. When using the Selfie story, you can add fun Snapchat-type filters to your face and post them.

## Part 4: How to Share a Facebook Post to Story?

Facebook is a popular social platform where people can share photos, videos, and statuses with their friends and family. The platform also allows you to share the Facebook post as a story. However, many people do not know how to do that. No worries, we are here to share that with you.

You can share the News Feed posts to your story depending on the privacy setting of the original post. To share a post from your timeline to the story, click on share below the post, and then choose Share to your story.

You can edit the story as you like, choose who can see your story, and then click on Share. When you share the post to your story, your friends can tap it to see the original post.

Please note, if the original post is deleted, the post will be removed from your story and your story archive.

## Part 5: How to Find Old Stories on Facebook?

It is difficult to find an old Facebook story as it is a temporary form of content visible only for 24 hours. However, if you have a feature Archive turned on, all your old Facebook stories are available to you.

You can find the old stories on the Facebook app by visiting the Story Archive section under the Settings option. Tap on the profile picture to open your profile, click on three horizontal dots to open Profile Setting, click on Archive, and choose Story Archive. All the stories you created in the past are shown here.

## Bonus: How to Share Instagram Story to Facebook Story?

Instagram allows its users to share the story to Facebook story directly. Make sure that your Instagram is linked to Facebook.

Once you have linked your accounts, open Story Control in the Instagram setting and share your stories to Facebook stories. Follow the steps below.

Step 1 – Log in to your Instagram, click on Your Story, and then tap on Send to.

Step 2 – As soon as you click on Send to, you see Your Story and Facebook story, click on Share, and your Instagram story is shared to the Facebook story.

If you want to share all future stories automatically to Facebook, then adjust your settings.

Step 1 – Go to your profile and tap on the Menu icon.

Step 2 – Here tap on Settings and choose Privacy.

Step 3 – From the given options, tap on Story, scroll down to find Share your story to Facebook, and turn it on.

Now, whenever you create a story on Instagram and share it, it is automatically shared to the Facebook story.

**Conclusion**
