### How to Find the Watch Later Videos on Facebook?

Did you know Facebook has a "Watch Later" feature for the desktop version? Yes, you can access this feature for Facebook posts. It appears as a small tab situated at the right side of the uploaded video. Through this feature, you can save a video to watch later. If you do so, the video gets saved in the "Saved" tab. This tab lies on the left side of the News Feed. From there, you can watch the saved item easily. This feature is pretty helpful for those who are in a hurry or cannot watch the video instantly. It's also easy to access them, whenever you want!

### What to Do If I Can't View or Play Videos on Facebook?

One of the most common problems with Facebook is when you want to watch a video but cannot do so. This could occur due to a bad internet connection or technical glitches. The best way to fix these issues is by following the below steps:

* **Check If You Have Strong Internet Connection:**

If you have a slow/dull internet connection there are chances that your video isn't playing due to the same. In that case, you can check for a slow connection by opening some other application. If it shows the same issues, switch to a stronger internet connection. Make sure to connect to strong WiFi or cellular data.

* **Go for a Quick Application Restart:**

Sometimes a quick restart can ensure a swift Facebook video play. So, close the Facebook application on your device and relaunch it. Alternatively, check if there are any recent updates available for the app. If you see any, update the app accordingly.

### How to Delete Watch History on Facebook?

Keep note that your watch history is accessible by you only. However, if you are still skeptical (due to privacy issues), delete the watch history of Facebook. Here's how you can do so:

* At first, log in to your Facebook account with the credentials (email and password).
* Click on Account>Settings & Privacy.
* Navigate to the Activity Log and then go to the Filter section.

![delete watch history on facebook](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watched-videos-on-facebook-4.jpg)

* Within the Categories, look for "Videos you've watched."
* From there, you can delete the videos one-by-one or clear the complete watch history.

### Can People See What I Watch On Facebook?

Some people may wonder whether anyone else can see what they watch on Facebook. Fortunately, no. No one can see your watch history. However, they can see the action you perform on the video. Here's a complete list of what other people can see:

* **Page:**If you like or follow a page, your friends may see it once they do the same. For example, if you have liked a page related to a Football team, a friend of yours may see your name in the list of followers/likes.

* **Video Likes:**Your name is visible on the likes of the video if you do the same. Say, if you have liked a video and any friend of yours comes across the post. They may see the term "\[Your Name\] also liked this." Similarly, your name is visible when you comment on the video.

* **Post Shares:**Your name is also visible if you share a video to your timeline or in case of direct messages.

### How Does Facebook Decide the Suggested Videos?

The videos suggested on Facebook appear because of liked pages and video popularity. You can customize the same through the below steps:

* Go to the left menu and click on "Watch" from your News Feed.

* Click on the right side of the video top and select "Hide Video." This will ensure you do not see similar videos.
