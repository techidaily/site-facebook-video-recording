Once 360 degree videos are available on Facebook live, viewers can easily download them. If you are using desktop to watch them then simply go to your favourite video post in your group, page or profile. Then expand its view and you will find three dot type icon on your screen. Hit this icon and soon you will be able to download your video to your device. It will get saved as like an equirectangle flattened image.

## Tips for Live 360

* Prefer to act as a narrator to engage your audience with 360 content.
* Use some creative techniques like adding 2D videos, text or overlay graphics to make your live videos more interesting.
* Manage a 20 to 30 feet distance between camera and objects being captured.
* It is good to utilize Guide feature to assist your audience.
* Users can edit spatial audios to Live 360 degree stream.
