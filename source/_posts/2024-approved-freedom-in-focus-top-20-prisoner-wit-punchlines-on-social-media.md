There was a time when we all were not so familiar with the trend of memes. Nowadays memes are becoming an integral part of our lives. People are becoming creative with meme-making to attract more followers and engage with them. Sometimes, because people are allowed to freely like and comment on any of the posts available on Facebook, they perform spam behavior or acts that do not comply with the platform’s guidelines. Therefore, to resolve that issue, Facebook jail has come into the picture. Due to the protection or privacy purpose of all the existing, Facebook community has started blocking unnecessary user actions with the Facebook jail concept.

It happens that the Facebook jail makes users get banned, blocked from accessing their accounts, or from posting on Facebook. It is not an actual jail but due to the funny name nowadays people are creating **Facebook jail memes** so much and that is on-trend too.

## Part 1: What does Facebook Jail Mean?

If you are a Facebook user, you might have observed that we get to see so many funny Facebook memes on the feed and the most recent ones are Facebook jail memes. Facebook jail is a new term and many of us are not aware of this.

[Facebook Jail](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the term used when an individual breaks the standard Facebook rules due to any violations, suspicious logins, or spammy behavior. So to prevent you from doing that Facebook suspends your account and make you in jail.

Also, this penalty could be for few hours to 21 days of restrictive actions.

There was a time when we all were not so familiar with the trend of memes. Nowadays memes are becoming an integral part of our lives. People are becoming creative with meme-making to attract more followers and engage with them. Sometimes, because people are allowed to freely like and comment on any of the posts available on Facebook, they perform spam behavior or acts that do not comply with the platform’s guidelines. Therefore, to resolve that issue, Facebook jail has come into the picture. Due to the protection or privacy purpose of all the existing, Facebook community has started blocking unnecessary user actions with the Facebook jail concept.

It happens that the Facebook jail makes users get banned, blocked from accessing their accounts, or from posting on Facebook. It is not an actual jail but due to the funny name nowadays people are creating **Facebook jail memes** so much and that is on-trend too.

## Part 1: What does Facebook Jail Mean?

If you are a Facebook user, you might have observed that we get to see so many funny Facebook memes on the feed and the most recent ones are Facebook jail memes. Facebook jail is a new term and many of us are not aware of this.

[Facebook Jail](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the term used when an individual breaks the standard Facebook rules due to any violations, suspicious logins, or spammy behavior. So to prevent you from doing that Facebook suspends your account and make you in jail.

Also, this penalty could be for few hours to 21 days of restrictive actions.
