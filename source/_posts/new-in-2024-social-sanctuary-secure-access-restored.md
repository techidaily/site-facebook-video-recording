<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### **Be Cautious of Unknown Devices and Networks**

In case of emergency, you may have to access your account from a public or unknown device. Make sure your log out and never click on **save the password** for this device.

### **Be Alert on Facebook Messenger**

![facebook messenger hacking video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-hack-get-your-account-back-11.jpg)

Never reply to messages which are unknown or click on links or watch doubtful videos. The links can automatically take you to dangerous sites. For example, the Facebook messenger hack video prompts you to open the video and leads to malicious websites.
