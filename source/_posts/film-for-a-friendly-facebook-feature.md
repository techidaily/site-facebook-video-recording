### Size of the Cover Video

There are no specified sizes of cover videos uploaded across Facebook. Considering the basic limit of Facebook, the platform allows users to upload videos as larger as 1.75GB in size. Try to choose a file size that is within the basic limits. It is preferably advised to avoid such large video files as it gets difficult for users to view the video due to slow browsing speeds.

### Dimensions to Be Followed

Facebook has set a particular set of dimensions for a **Facebook banner video** that you create for your page or business. With the default requirements of 820 x 312 pixels, the optimal dimensions that are believed to be the perfect fit for a Facebook cover video are 820 x 462 pixels.
