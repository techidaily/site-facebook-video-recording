### 1\. Overview

 What is overview all about? The overview gives you a complete picture of your and your audience’s activities on your page for a week. The prime things that it covers are how many likes, comments, and shares your post received over a week, the number of people who viewed your content for one week, and the number of likes your page received.

### 3\. Post Reach

 The Post Reach helps you to understand how many people viewed your posts and how they interacted or responded to it. It is divided into 4 prime metrics. The Post Reach shows you the number of people who were exposed to a particular post. It is further broken into paid and organic reach.
