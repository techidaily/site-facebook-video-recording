This video was among the most viral videos as it features a clip from the infamous 2019 Movie ‘Ford vs. Ferrari.’ It has amassed 8.5 million views and 92 thousand likes and reactions, plus 1.9k comments.

The Facebook video’s main highlight is how Ken Miles, one of the main characters, qualifies to rate for the major racing event ‘Le Mans.’

The vice president of Ford Motor Company, Leo Beebe, is shown arguing with Ken Miles, a hot-headed British racer and a struggling mechanic who helps Carroll Shelby build the Ford GT40 Mk for Henry Ford II.

As the prototype car is ready, Leo Beebe opts to send another racer to test it in its first racing event, ‘Daytona,’ instead of Ken Miles himself.

However, just at the right time, Henry Ford II appears for a test drive of the machine he has invested $9 million in, and Carroll Shelby takes him for a spin. Dumbfounded by the car’s potential, Henry Ford II allows Ken Miles to race Daytona on Shelby’s request overriding Leo Beebe’s order.

Towards the end of the clip, Ken Miles appears to be losing the Daytona event, but with a secret trick up their sleeves, Carrol Shelby clears Miles to push the car beyond the 7000 RPM tachometer red line.

Everyone is skeptical about pushing the car to its limits, but Ken Miles, knowing what he built, pushes the car in the last lap and, to everyone’s surprise, passes all the cars and wins the event. The end of the video shows his team shouting and cheering him up and a disappointed and fumed Leo Beebe.

This video was uploaded on 1st June 2021 by the Facebook page named ‘LADbible Australia’ and has amassed a total of 65 million views, 185 thousand likes, and reacts, along with 9 thousand comments.

It features a daughter asking her dad riddles, and the dad is simply amazing at solving them. The girl tries hard to trap his father, but he gets back to her every time. The riddles are quite challenging yet funny. The video went viral on TikTok and has made rounds on Facebook since.

She asks the dad to name three consecutive days without using the words Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, to which the dad thinks for a minute and, to her surprise, replies with the correct answer that is ‘Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow.’

The last riddle almost gets the dad when the daughter asks, ‘There are 30 cows in a field and 28 (20 ate) chickens; how many did not?’ Dad is stuck for a few minutes and struggles to figure out the answer, but he eventually gets it.

The viral video picturizes the beautiful relationship with her dad, and the viewers have enjoyed the sight of it along with the riddles! To watch the video, click on the link:
