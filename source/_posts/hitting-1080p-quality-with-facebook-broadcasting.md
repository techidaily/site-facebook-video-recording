However, before creators lead towards their stream, an essential requirement needs to be looked into.

Streaming in HD is only possible if the user sends 1080p from their side. If, by any chance, the stream is 720p, Facebook would be unable to provide 1080p quality across its output. Uniformity is extremely important before guiding towards quality. Facebook allows users to select their choice for the live streaming software. Although the platform can be directly utilized for this purpose, several other software is supported throughout the live stream.

Users can consider using OBS Studio, Wirecast, or XSplit to cater to their streaming requirements. Facebook allows its users to consider any of the software mentioned above for their purpose. For going into a live stream, the user can consider going from a profile, Facebook page, group, or event. With diversity in selecting the source for going live, users can consider going live by sharing their screen, game, or external camera as the video resource.

Before going to **stream 1080p Facebook,** you might need to enable stream settings for your account. To carry this out, you are advised to look into the following steps in detail.
