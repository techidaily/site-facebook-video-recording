## Part 1: Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?

The YouTube videos that you share on Facebook do not play automatically. Facebook does not give the privilege to YouTube to play videos on their platform.

Thus, when you share a YouTube video on Facebook, it shows in the form of a link instead of a video player.

Now the question is, what can you do?

There are two ways you can go about in order to enable the autoplay feature for your YouTube videos.

### First Method

The first method that we will introduce here is for those who have a YouTube channel of their own and want to transfer their videos from YouTube to Facebook and enable autoplay.

The unfortunate thing is that YouTube does not have a feature that allows you to share videos as videos instead of an embed link. So, we look at third-party apps for help.

One of such third-party apps is TubeBuddy. It is an amazing app for YouTube Channel Management that we will use here to solve our little problem.

We will now provide you with a step-by-step guide for uploading your YouTube videos to Facebook with the help of TubeBuddy.

**Step 1: Go to your YouTube Channel**

The first step is to go to your YouTube channel and select the video you want to share.

### Second Method

The second method of ensuring the autoplay feature works with your videos is to upload them directly from your computer. You can also download videos from YouTube using third-party services and then upload them on Facebook.

Go to YouTube, search for the video you want to share on Facebook, and open it.

**Step 3: Use Any Third-Party Service**

Some different third-party apps and websites help you convert and download YouTube videos. Just a quick Google search will help you out with finding one.

Paste the URL in the app or website. Then download the video.

**Step 4: Upload the Video to Facebook.**

Once you have the video on your computer, go to Facebook. On the home page, you will see an option to upload a Photo/Video below the status bar.

![Status bar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-5.jpg)

Our social lives have shifted almost completely to social media apps, where we tend to share anything and everything with our friends and family. We often find ourselves in a situation where we see something funny or interesting on YouTube and immediately want to share it on our Facebook.

We can easily share YouTube videos on Facebook. Here is the complete guide on sharing youtube videos on Facebook.

However, when you share something from YouTube to Facebook, it adds an embed link, and the video does not support autoplay on Facebook.

So, to help you avoid that problem, we will give you a step-by-step guide in this article.

#### In this article

Part 1: [Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?](#step1)

Part 2: [How to Turn Facebook Video Autoplay On/Off?](#step2)

## Part 1: Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?

The YouTube videos that you share on Facebook do not play automatically. Facebook does not give the privilege to YouTube to play videos on their platform.

Thus, when you share a YouTube video on Facebook, it shows in the form of a link instead of a video player.

Now the question is, what can you do?

There are two ways you can go about in order to enable the autoplay feature for your YouTube videos.

### First Method

The first method that we will introduce here is for those who have a YouTube channel of their own and want to transfer their videos from YouTube to Facebook and enable autoplay.

The unfortunate thing is that YouTube does not have a feature that allows you to share videos as videos instead of an embed link. So, we look at third-party apps for help.

One of such third-party apps is TubeBuddy. It is an amazing app for YouTube Channel Management that we will use here to solve our little problem.

We will now provide you with a step-by-step guide for uploading your YouTube videos to Facebook with the help of TubeBuddy.

**Step 1: Go to your YouTube Channel**

The first step is to go to your YouTube channel and select the video you want to share.

![Go to the YouTube channel and select the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-1.jpg)

**Step 2: Go to the TubeBuddy Dropdown Menu**

Click on the TubeBuddy Dropdown menu. You will see a lot of different tabs here.

**Step 4: Set the Desired Settings**
