 To celebrate its 10th anniversary, Facebook recently launched a [Look Back Page](https://www.facebook.com/lookback). If you visit that page, Facebook's algorithm will auto-generate a video of your profile history. It will show the year you joined Facebook, your most-liked photos, statuses with the most engagement, accompanied with a standard piece of music.

 It's pretty cool. But unfortunately, Facebook’s choice of pictures isn't. You may have to see some embarrassing old photos, or status updates that were funny at the time. In that case, you need to select the pictures of your choice, right?

 The good new is that, Facebook has introduced a new editor now, which lets you choose your favorite images for the video. To edit the Look Back video, simply hit the "Edit" button on the top right corner of the Look Back page. Then un-check the photos and updates you don't want in your video, and check the ones that you want include. Once you're done, click the green "Share Your Movie" button at the top of the page.

 To share the unforgettable moments in Look Back video, adding texts is a good idea. To do this, switch to Text tab and you'll see various texts templates on the left panel. Choose your favorite one and place it on the Timeline. Then the text thumbnail with a leading letter "T" will appear on the timeline. Double click it to type your texts in the box and select the font, color, animation, etc. Hit "Return" to confirm the settings and go back to the primary window.

#### 3. Edit the audio of Look Back video

 To adjust the background music of Look Back video, double click the video on the Timeline. In the pop up editing panel, switch to Audio column and change the Speed, Volume, Pitch of the audio file or add the Fade in/out effect as you like.

 If you don't like the original background music of your Look Back video, just replace it and add a new one. To do this, right click the video and select the "Audio Detach" option. Then the background music will immediately be separated and appear on the music timeline. You can easily delete it and add a new one.
