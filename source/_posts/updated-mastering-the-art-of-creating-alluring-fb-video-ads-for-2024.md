### 5\. Content Quality

For your Facebook ads video, you should maintain the quality of the content.

### 5\. Content Quality

For your Facebook ads video, you should maintain the quality of the content. Although it is mentioned to take care of the video length yet, the video must cover the essentials for the brand and the product.
