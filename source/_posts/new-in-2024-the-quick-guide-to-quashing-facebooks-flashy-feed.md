A Facebook story will last for 24 hours. Once the 24 hours timeline is over, your Facebook story is removed automatically. However, you may want to delete your Facebook story before it reaches the end of its timeline for a reason. What is essential to understand is that your Facebook stories are not like your Facebook posts. Facebook posts remain for as long as you want. But the stories will vanish after 24 hours. If you want to remove a story on your page before the 24-hour time limit elapses, you have come to the right place. This blog will help you understand **how to delete Facebook stories** both from your desktop and mobile app.
