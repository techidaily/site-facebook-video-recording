Adding a link to a Facebook story can be a boon for companies to enhance their sales. This link can boost CTR, click-through rate. Companies should think about adding a link related to their services and products in order to grow their engagement, strengthen their relationship with their prospective audience, and build brand awareness. Facebook stories are not like the regular posts that you see. It appears right on top of people’s feed.
