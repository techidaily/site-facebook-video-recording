## Part 1: All You Need to Know About Facebook Messenger

The world of instant messaging has transformed since the advent of Messenger. In August, 2011 the facebook chat was replaced by Messenger but you can use Messenger even when you don’t have a facebook account. The app can be used on web, desktop and mobile apps, including Android and Apple, which makes it compatible with the Apple watch.

Essentially, Messenger is a texting app that allows you to text a person one-on-one or chat in a group. Upon all that messenger allows you to use emojis that reflect your emotions. But, the best part is how you can easily share videos, pictures and documents in Messenger.

Facebook Messenger comes with an array of great features including reacting on messages and media, read receipts, time stamps on messages, customizing your chat style etc.

Amongst all the fantastic features of Facebook Messenger, it collects all the media files you share in a chat and stores them in a single folder. This allows you to quickly view all the files that you have shared in a chat. This is what makes this app a fan favorite.

For all those unfamiliar with the last feature, we will guide you in detail on how you can access photos and videos in your messenger chat.

## Finding Photos And Videos on Messenger Website
