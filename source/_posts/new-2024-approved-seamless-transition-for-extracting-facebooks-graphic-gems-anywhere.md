## Part 1: Download GIF from Facebook on PC

GIFs are an ideal quick-loading, colorful, and animated visual communication medium. An excellent approach of visual interaction designed previously for slow and limited internet connections now has evolved into a robust and vivid instant communication channel in the world of social media. Happiness makes us want to share, and sadness helps us connect, and GIFs give our emotions the striking visual flair for instant sharing on social media.

Often you love a GIF on Facebook but are not able to share it with your friends because you could not download it on your PC. To help you easily share your emotions on the social world, and download Facebook GIF, follow the steps below.

1\. Downloading GIFs from Facebook on the PC or a Mac system is a pretty simple and straightforward process. Open the Facebook website on your browser and go to the GIF you want to download.
