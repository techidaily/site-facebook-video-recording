### 1\. Provide complete and detailed information

If you want to get verified, you need to fill out as much information as possible in order for the reviewing process is fast. You need to go to your about page to enter some information including phone number, email, company overview, address, and products. It is noted that you don't need to fill out all information as details are much more important.

### 2\. Professional Facebook page is needed

You don't want to give Facebook the impression that you are not professional with wrong info and an ugly page interface. The first thing you need to do is update the banner and then your logo as they are the first two things people would notice at first glance. Besides, you also need to remove low-quality images, poor articles, and posts. All in all, information centered with the brand is the symbol of a professional looking for getting Facebook verification.

When Facebook reviews your account, it takes time to give you the blue badge. You need to provide the latest and detailed information to get a quick review. It is not important if your posts are engaging or how many likes you get. The most important thing is correct. If some info is wrong, the chance you get rejected is higher.
