* Use high-quality images that are eye-catching and relevant to your product or service.

There are a few reasons why you need to make a creative image before running a Facebook an Ad:

First, an eye-catching image will help to grab the reader's attention and make them more likely to read your ad.

Second, including relevant images with your ad will help to illustrate your product or service and make it easier for your audience to understand what you're selling.

## Difference between Facebook Ads and Facebook Post

A Facebook post is simply a message that you post on your Facebook page. A Facebook ad is a message that you pay to have displayed on other people's Facebook pages. There are a few key differences between Facebook posts and ads:

* Facebook posts are free to create, while Facebook ads require a payment.
* Facebook posts are only visible to people who have liked your page, while Facebook ads can be targeted to specific audiences.
* Facebook ads can include more information than posts, including clickable links and images.
* Facebook ads will always be shown in the News Feed, while Facebook posts may not be seen by all of your followers.

## The Three Simple Copywriting Structures

**#1\. Connect to the Pain of your Target Audience**

The first step in creating an effective Facebook ad is to connect with the pain of your target audience. What problem are they trying to solve? What need do they have that your product or service can fill?

For example, if you're selling a weight loss product, you might want to speak to the pain of being overweight or feeling self-conscious about one's appearance.

**#2\. Introduce the Solution**

Once you've connected with the pain of your target audience, you can introduce the solution that your product or service provides. This is where you talk about what your product or service can do for them.

For example, if you're selling a weight loss product, you might want to talk about how your product can help them to lose weight and feel more confident.

**#3\. Call to Action**

The last step in creating an effective Facebook ad is to include a call to action. This is where you tell the reader what you want them to do next. Do you want them to click on your ad, visit your website, or purchase your product? Make sure your call to action is clear and concise.

For example, if you want the reader to click on your ad, you might say something like "Click here to learn more about our weight loss product."
