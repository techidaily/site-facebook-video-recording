Right-click on the video and choose “Save to Facebook” if you want to add it to your online collection or click on Download video to save it on your Windows PC.

### Save Messenger Videos on Mac

Following are the steps to save Messenger Videos on a Mac. Although the steps are quite similar to those used in a Windows PC, some things may vary due to the different operating systems.

**Step 1: Open Messenger**

Since macOS does not support applications, you will have to use the dedicated Safari Browser or another third-party browser and open Facebook Messenger.

**Step 2: Log in**

Log in to your Facebook account using your credentials and open the chat that has the video you wish to save.

**Step 3: Select the Desired Option**

Right-click on the video and choose “Save to Facebook” if you want to add it to your online collection or click on Download video to save it on your Mac.

## Download Facebook Messenger Videos on Web Browser

Sometimes, the in-built download option is unavailable in some updates or under some circumstances, or the video is not directly from the sender's phone. You may need some tricks on your web browser to do the job.

Following are the steps to do so.

### Step 1: Log in

Log in to your Facebook account by putting in your credentials.

![Log in to Facebook](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/download-videos-from-facebook-messenger-1.jpg)

### Step 2: Open Messenger

After logging in, open Facebook Messenger by clicking on the messenger icon to open your chats and then open the conversation with the video you wish to download.
