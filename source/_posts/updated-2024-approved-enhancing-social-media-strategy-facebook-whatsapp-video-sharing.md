### 1.2 Method 2: Use a Reliable App to Download Facebook Videos

If the video you want to share is of a group where your friend or family is not present, it would not be accessible. So, it's better first to download the video, and then share it. In this method, we will use a reliable and third-party app, i.e., FastVid, to download videos directly from Facebook.

[FastVid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fb.video.downloader&hl=en&gl=US) is one of the most reliable apps to download Facebook videos instantly. It has great reviews as the powerful Facebook video downloader as it is free from viruses and does not take much time to download. To use this method, we have mentioned the steps below on **how to share a video clip from Facebook to WhatsApp** through FastVid:

**Step 1:** To begin, go to the Play Store and download FastVid on your Android device using a strong Wi-Fi connection. Open the Facebook app and navigate to the video you want to download. Tap on the "Share" icon of that video and then select the option of "Copy Link." By doing so, the URL address of that video would be copied to your clipboard.
