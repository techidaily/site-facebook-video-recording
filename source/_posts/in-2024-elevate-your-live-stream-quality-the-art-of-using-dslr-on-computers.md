### Conclusion

 You can easily find so many people who use DSLR cameras instead of web cams but it is not always a good idea. The fact is the when sensor of a DSLR camera stays ON for long time, it suffers huge damage. Open shutter leads to potential harm to your camera. It is good to use DSLR for short while but if you are a beginner and need a device to begin with then prefer to pick right webcam for your needs.
