 Once applying the changes, you can relaunch Zoom and see if the camera is able to work correctly. If not, check out the next fix below.

### Fix 2 – Close other programs that use the camera

1. Right-click the empty space on your taskbar and click**Task Manager** .

 Restart Zoom and test. If the error reoccurs, continue to the next solution.

1. Launch your Zoom app.
2. Click the**gear icon** at the top right corner.
