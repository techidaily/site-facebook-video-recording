When you talk about videos, Facebook always recommends to upload videos with square (1:1) or vertical (9:16, 4:5, and 16:9) aspect ratios. As a result, it increases the compatibility on mobile and desktop screens.

Facebook also suggests you upload short videos (15 seconds or less) and design videos that work both without and with sound. It would be best if you enable the captions. For the best results, choose the following specifications for videos:
