### 3\. Keep your Facebook video short

Like text content, your Facebook Marketing video should also be crisp and short. Video with a fresh and fascinatingly entertaining content becomes a potential viral video. Creating them in widely used language (such as English) would garner more popularity sans the cultural or geographical background of a person.

Shorter videos between 2 minutes effectively perform in comparison to longer versions. But, ensure that the gist of your message should be delivered within that time frame. Make the video so understandable and connecting, that words just add charm to it and not solely define it.
