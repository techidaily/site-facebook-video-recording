However, while covering the best possible case of sharing videos across Instagram through smartphones in the parts above, this is the most that a user can do without turning themselves into difficulty. To find variety in sharing content, users can turn onto the desktop version for different results.

Sharing content from Facebook to Instagram never came as an option across the platform. It was not available until recently; Facebook introduced cross-posting across its desktop tool. To clarify, this feature is not yet available across the mobile applications of Facebook. Cross-posting, however, is believed to be taken to greater bounds which would then be made available across the mobile versions.

Before leading to the steps that would explain the process of cross-posting, it is important to realize the reasons that are associated with cross-posting. This is quite similar to sharing content rather than reposting content across the accounts. One of the major reasons for opting for this feature is to save time and effort for users.

These restrictions and limitations are believed to be for a while, which would be then left alone after consistent development.

This feature across Facebook is not available across personal accounts for now. Only users with business pages can consider utilizing this feature. Along with that, users need to be aware of the fact that they can only consider using the "Post Now" option instead of the "Post Later" option, as cross-posting cannot work under the latter option. There is a lot that this feature has to yet come up with while making the usability more effective.

While keeping these limitations within consideration, cross-posting can be considered to **share Facebook video to Instagram.** For this, the user is advised to look into the steps that are featured below. The steps show a clear understanding of how the user needs to utilize cross-posting to share their required content across Instagram without any difficulty.

**Step 1: Locate the Settings within Facebook Page**
