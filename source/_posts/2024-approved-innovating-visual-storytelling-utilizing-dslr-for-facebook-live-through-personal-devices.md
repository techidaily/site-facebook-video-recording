### 1.[OBS](https://obsproject.com/ )

**Pros:**

* OBS is an open source tool available for free.
* Offers solid screen switching facility.
* Considered as a global source.
**Cons**

![ obs-studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-studio.jpg)

### 2\. [XSplit:](https://www.xsplit.com )

The fact is the when sensor of a DSLR camera stays ON for long time, it suffers huge damage. Open shutter leads to potential harm to your camera. It is good to use DSLR for short while but if you are a beginner and need a device to begin with then prefer to pick right webcam for your needs.
