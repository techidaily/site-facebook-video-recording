### Save Messenger Videos on Mac

Following are the steps to save Messenger Videos on a Mac. Although the steps are quite similar to those used in a Windows PC, some things may vary due to the different operating systems.

Since macOS does not support applications, you will have to use the dedicated Safari Browser or another third-party browser and open Facebook Messenger.

**Step 2: Log in**

Log in to your Facebook account using your credentials and open the chat that has the video you wish to save.

**Step 3: Select the Desired Option**

Right-click on the video and choose “Save to Facebook” if you want to add it to your online collection or click on Download video to save it on your Mac.

Following are the steps to do so.

### Step 1: Log in

Log in to your Facebook account by putting in your credentials.
