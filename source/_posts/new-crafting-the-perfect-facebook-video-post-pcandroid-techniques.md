## Part 3: Why uploading video to Facebook is failed

 The disheartening time is when you miserably [fail to share video](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-reasons-a-video-wont-upload-to-Facebook) you dearly captured and you end up with a Why loop? From now onwards, you won’t be as we have summed up possible reasons which hampers the process of uploading the video over your Facebook account. Read the following situations to get the better understanding of the uploading process.

### 1\. Format

 Uploading videos over Facebook may not be an easy-peasy task, as the first thing one has to keep in mind is the video file types it supports such as WMV, FLV or 3GP etc. Also, if the file is not suppressed up to Facebook’s expectations then also the user would face problems in uploading the videos to your Facebook handle.

### 2\. Web Browsers

 Facebook smoothly works in most of the popular web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera or Internet Explorer. But, there are times when you try to upload the video on Facebook via these browsers but fails miserably. It may be because, that your web browser may not be upgraded to the latest version which may be the root cause of not uploading your video easily.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### 3\. Video Specifications

 The other possible reasons of failure can be due to the fact that dimensions of your video are not falling under the multiples of 16 px. And if your video exceeds the sides by 120 px, then too it would fail to upload. So, one must ensure to make the adjustments accordingly. Bonus tip, keep the Facebook frame be at 30 fps.
