Log in to your Facebook account using your credentials and open the chat that has the video you wish to save.

**Step 3: Select the Desired Option**

Right-click on the video and choose “Save to Facebook” if you want to add it to your online collection or click on Download video to save it on your Mac.

Following are the steps to do so.

### Step 1: Log in

Log in to your Facebook account by putting in your credentials.
