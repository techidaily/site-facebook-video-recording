 Finally you have to update the ‘About’ section of your profile. Add your contact information, gender, age, and religion as well as relationship status as per your choice. Update few attractive quotes to make it more interesting.

#### Step 7.Find your Friends

 In this last step you are now ready to make connections online. Facebook can help you to get connected with your friends and relatives. To do this, you need to search for your desired profiles and then send friend requests. Here are two techniques to send friend requests:

**Search:** You will find a search bar on the top of screen, enter name of your friends over there and as soon as you find them hit the “send friend request” button.

**Import:** Facebook also allows users to directly import their contacts. It can search contacts via Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, AIM, Live Messenger etc. Simply move to find friend page to get started with this feature.
