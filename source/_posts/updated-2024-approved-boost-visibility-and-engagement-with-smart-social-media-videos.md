## Boost Visibility and Engagement with Smart Social Media Videos

Social media video is becoming the norm today, be it Facebook or any other platform. With more than [1.9 billion](http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/03/technology/facebook-earnings/index.html) monthly users on Facebook, these videos have a wide audience.

Facebook video marketing is imperative for promoting your business and makes your online presence felt. Keeping this fact in mind, Facebook is focusing more on video content to be adapted within their algorithm and enabling features like auto-play. In this post, we will tell you how to do Facebook video marketing.

## 10 tips for Facebook video marketing

### 1\. Facebook Live video is a trend

Since last year, the average time for consuming Facebook Live videos has increased four-fold. Reports from Facebook’s research reveal that video content is consumed five times more than static content by the users.

Facebook Live has taken things to a new level. As soon as you go live on Facebook, your friends and followers/subscribers get notifications automatically.

Facebook video marketing seems great where you can live interact with your consumers about your products/services or a promotional event. You get feedbacks, suggestions for improvements, or outright praise from them.

### 2\. Upload Videos Directly to Facebook rather than YouTube

Though videos on YouTube usually get views but uploading directly on to Facebook would bring more viewership for your social media video.

Videos on Facebook perform better than other platforms for video sharing denotes a popular source. Apart from that compared to photo and other graphic posts, videos receive a whopping 135% higher organic search on Facebook.

Facebook marketing videos are becoming the strongest confidants of business owners nowadays due to these facts.

The default auto-play feature even makes things lot better, as people stop by to watch at least 5-6 seconds of the video while scrolling down and get hooked to it, without even searching for it.

The video view counter helps you estimate the way your viral video fared. You can understand users’ behavior to understand their needs and what can you do to bring them to you again.

### 3\. Keep your Facebook video short

Like text content, your Facebook Marketing video should also be crisp and short. Video with a fresh and fascinatingly entertaining content becomes a potential viral video. Creating them in widely used language (such as English) would garner more popularity sans the cultural or geographical background of a person.

Shorter videos between 2 minutes effectively perform in comparison to longer versions. But, ensure that the gist of your message should be delivered within that time frame. Make the video so understandable and connecting, that words just add charm to it and not solely define it.

A majority of Facebook users watch videos on their mobile phone or tablets. So shooting your social media video in vertical mode is pleasing to the eyes, while viewing it on a mobile.

### 5\. Feature a Video on Facebook Page

Just like featured photos on the about section of your Facebook page, you can add your Facebook marketing video as a featured video. When people love your video they keep on sharing it to their near and dear ones, be it about anything.

It will make your video get popular and go viral as well in case it gets shared fast in a large number. Ensure that the video has a prominent thumbnail on your about page.

You can use it to promote an event, launch a product or service, or a teaser about some upcoming surprises. The clearer it gets on your page, the more clicks you will get from the audience.

### 6\. Carefully choose thumbnail

Well! We have just said about the thumbnail on your Facebook video. The social media video you upload on Facebook will garner more viewership with a suitable and attractive thumbnail.

When there is a weak internet connection, the videos on Facebook might not auto-play; they would display a static image there. Don’t exceed the 90 characters Ad copy limit for the thumbnail, in case your video has text on it. Try to keep it as less as you can to adhere to Facebook’s 20% text policy.
