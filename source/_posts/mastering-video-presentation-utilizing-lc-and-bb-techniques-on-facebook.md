First let us start with the question, what is a letterbox for a Facebook video?

**Adding a letterbox** simply means transferring a widescreen aspect ratio video or footage to a video format with a standard width, without cropping or changing the aspect ratio of the original footage. An increasing number of people prefer to create a letterbox for their video and upload it to Facebook, as it imparts a cinematic look to the video, and is easy to get more likes. You can see the difference between before and after adding a letterbox

## Get Started with Filmora

A square video in a **1:1 aspect ratio** is preferred by Facebook. There are varieties of video editing apps available in the market that allows you to create a square video and add a letterbox on it. But most of them have a complicated interface and you might need to watch a lot of video tutorials to make head and tail of it. If you want to add such a letterbox for your Facebook video, Wondershare Filmora may be a good choice for you. Currently, Filmora offers two ways to add a letterbox for your square Facebook video.

## Method 1: Make a Letterbox by Project Ratio Mismatch

This method is suitable for users whose source videos are not in square format (1:1). It is a simple method in which the aspect ratios of the source and project videos are compared. In this method, a letterbox will be created automatically when there is a mismatch between the aspect ratio of the original video and the project you are creating using the Filmora application. Let us see how this can be done:

* 1\. Open Filmora, start the project at **1:1** square or Instagram mode

![start-filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-filmora9.jpg)

* 2\. Go to **File**\-**Import Media** and import the source file to the Media library (let’s say it’s 1920\*1080 at 16:9)

![import-sample-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-sample-video.jpg)

* 3\. Drag and drop the source video to the timeline, and a black letterbox will be created automatically in the preview window, cause the source file didn’t match the 1:1 ratio you set for the project

First let us start with the question, what is a letterbox for a Facebook video?

**Adding a letterbox** simply means transferring a widescreen aspect ratio video or footage to a video format with a standard width, without cropping or changing the aspect ratio of the original footage. An increasing number of people prefer to create a letterbox for their video and upload it to Facebook, as it imparts a cinematic look to the video, and is easy to get more likes. You can see the difference between before and after adding a letterbox

A square video in a **1:1 aspect ratio** is preferred by Facebook.

## Method 1: Make a Letterbox by Project Ratio Mismatch

This method is suitable for users whose source videos are not in square format (1:1). It is a simple method in which the aspect ratios of the source and project videos are compared. In this method, a letterbox will be created automatically when there is a mismatch between the aspect ratio of the original video and the project you are creating using the Filmora application. Let us see how this can be done:

* 1\. Open Filmora, start the project at **1:1** square or Instagram mode

![start-filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-filmora9.jpg)

* 2\. Go to **File**\-**Import Media** and import the source file to the Media library (let’s say it’s 1920\*1080 at 16:9)

![import-sample-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-sample-video.jpg)

* 3\. Drag and drop the source video to the timeline, and a black letterbox will be created automatically in the preview window, cause the source file didn’t match the 1:1 ratio you set for the project
