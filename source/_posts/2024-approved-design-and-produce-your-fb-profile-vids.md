Cover videos have been a tactic to allure new customers into the offered product or service. To ensure that the developed video is of the highest of qualities, you need to look into the specifications of a basic or **animated Facebook cover,** as shown below.

### Size of the Cover Video

There are no specified sizes of cover videos uploaded across Facebook. Considering the basic limit of Facebook, the platform allows users to upload videos as larger as 1.75GB in size. Try to choose a file size that is within the basic limits. It is preferably advised to avoid such large video files as it gets difficult for users to view the video due to slow browsing speeds.

### Dimensions to Be Followed

Facebook has set a particular set of dimensions for a **Facebook banner video** that you create for your page or business. With the default requirements of 820 x 312 pixels, the optimal dimensions that are believed to be the perfect fit for a Facebook cover video are 820 x 462 pixels.

![dimension for facebook cover video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-cover-video-2.jpg)

It is highly advised that the dimensions set by Facebook should be followed for the best results. However, the Facebook mobile application has something else to say about the size of a cover video. The application cuts off the sides of the video and restricts the display to 640 x 360 pixels. To counter the issue regarding cutting off the sides of the video, users are highly advised to keep their text-centered throughout the video.
