## Part 3: How to Fix Scrambled Facebook Videos on Android?

The section is sketched out for you if you are an Android user. Whenever you run into a pixelated and scrambled video, you question yourself, "**why are Facebook videos scrambled**?" There are three methods to nip the issue in the bud once and for all.

### Fix 1: No Video Sharing on Any Platform

The first fix eliminates the concern "**Facebook videos blurry**" as it focuses on an important pointer. We often share the video before uploading it for multiple reasons, such as taking someone's opinion and getting positive feedback. But it interferes with the video quality and makes it scrambled.

The users are suggested to avoid sharing on other platforms. However, if you share the file via Bluetooth, Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox no video compression occurs, and the issue would be killed without surfacing.

![multiple cloud services](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-videos-blurry-3.jpg)

### Fix 2: Accessing Facebook's Camera

Using Facebook's camera works in the long run if scrambled videos are ruining the video quality. It may not reduce the pixelated effect, but the user would immediately find out how the video will be displayed on the timeline.

### Fix 3: Facebook App Upgradation

The last feasible method revolves around updating the Facebook app to eliminate all the possible causes of occurrence of scrambled Facebook videos. The step-by-step guide to upgrade the Facebook app is given below:

**Step 1:** For starters, hold your Android phone and head to "Play Store." Click on "Manage Apps and Device" from your account options. There, you will find "Updates Available."

**Step 2:** Click on it and find Facebook in the list. Tap "Update" afterward. The updating will begin and conclude in a couple of minutes.

Even if you play a video of 1080p resolution, Facebook controls the display settings. It is because the high-quality videos take longer to load. The display settings are tailored to low quality to be played without facing the buffering issue. It makes the video blurry.

The ideal Facebook video size is 720p. Facebook compresses the video that plays a vital role in optimizing the storage space and sustaining the servers. It is one of the primary reasons **Facebook videos blurry Chrome.**
