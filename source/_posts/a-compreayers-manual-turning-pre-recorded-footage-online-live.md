## Part 1\. How to Make Pre-Recorded Facebook Videos?

Be it the content of the recorded video or any other reason; you may stream a pre-recorded Facebook video for multiple motives. Now, the appropriate way to do so is through video recording/editing softwares like Wondershare Filmora. With multiple formats supporting and an in-built video recorder, this tool is a complete package for live streamings.

It's an efficient way to transfer video to any famous portable device. The tool comes with an effortless user interface where you can employ videos in any possible way. It also records your screen to help you with hassle-free streaming. The process of recording is quite straightforward and involves the following steps:

1. Install and open the Wondershare Filmora software. Double click on its desktop icon to launch the "Full Feature" mode.

Select anyone from the three options, i.e. Full Screen, Custom, or Target Window. While the Full-Screen option records your entire screen, the Custom option allows you to modify a screen section for recording.  
If you want, you can resize the area or make adjustments through custom resolutions (width and height). Lastly, the Target Window allows you to select a program, browser or any other window for recording.

* **Quality:**To select from the multiple quality options (good, better, best) for streaming.
* **Record Timer:**To assign a time slot where your recording stops automatically. Do not tick the option if you want manual customization.
* **Mouse:**To select if you want to display the mouse clicks during the recording.
* **Pause/Resume Hotkey:**To select a keyboard key for pausing and resuming the recording.
* **Start/Stop Hotkey:**To select a keyboard key to start or stop the recording.
