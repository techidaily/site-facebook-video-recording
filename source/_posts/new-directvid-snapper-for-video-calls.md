### Save Messenger Videos on Mac

Following are the steps to save Messenger Videos on a Mac. Although the steps are quite similar to those used in a Windows PC, some things may vary due to the different operating systems.

**Step 1: Open Messenger**

Since macOS does not support applications, you will have to use the dedicated Safari Browser or another third-party browser and open Facebook Messenger.

**Step 2: Log in**

Log in to your Facebook account using your credentials and open the chat that has the video you wish to save.

**Step 3: Select the Desired Option**

Right-click on the video and choose “Save to Facebook” if you want to add it to your online collection or click on Download video to save it on your Mac.
