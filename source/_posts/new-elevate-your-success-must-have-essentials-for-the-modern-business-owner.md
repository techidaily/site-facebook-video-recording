![The Ford GT... Ford v Ferrari](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/8-trending-videos-on-facebook-files-1.jpg)

This video was among the most viral videos as it features a clip from the infamous 2019 Movie ‘Ford vs. Ferrari.’ It has amassed 8.5 million views and 92 thousand likes and reactions, plus 1.9k comments.

The Facebook video’s main highlight is how Ken Miles, one of the main characters, qualifies to rate for the major racing event ‘Le Mans.’

The vice president of Ford Motor Company, Leo Beebe, is shown arguing with Ken Miles, a hot-headed British racer and a struggling mechanic who helps Carroll Shelby build the Ford GT40 Mk for Henry Ford II.

As the prototype car is ready, Leo Beebe opts to send another racer to test it in its first racing event, ‘Daytona,’ instead of Ken Miles himself.

However, just at the right time, Henry Ford II appears for a test drive of the machine he has invested $9 million in, and Carroll Shelby takes him for a spin. Dumbfounded by the car’s potential, Henry Ford II allows Ken Miles to race Daytona on Shelby’s request overriding Leo Beebe’s order.

Towards the end of the clip, Ken Miles appears to be losing the Daytona event, but with a secret trick up their sleeves, Carrol Shelby clears Miles to push the car beyond the 7000 RPM tachometer red line.

Everyone is skeptical about pushing the car to its limits, but Ken Miles, knowing what he built, pushes the car in the last lap and, to everyone’s surprise, passes all the cars and wins the event. The end of the video shows his team shouting and cheering him up and a disappointed and fumed Leo Beebe.

## Video number 7: The Beauty of Tennis

![The beauty of tennis.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/8-trending-videos-on-facebook-files-7.jpg)

This one is for the sportsmen out there! This short video was uploaded by the Facebook page ‘Tennis Instinct’ on 18 June 2020 and received 9.4M views after going viral immediately.

It features a short clip from a tennis match played between the famous tennis players Rafael Nadal and Gilles Muller. The clip is of a point played with extremely difficult tosses exchanged, and it was unexplained how the professional players managed to save the point by their extraordinary talent.

They played the ball several times before Nadal got the point, and that too by a very minute margin on the line; otherwise, the point would’ve gone to Muller, thanks to the modern monitoring systems and high-speed cameras.

It shows the beauty of the game and the polished game presented by the professional players.
