Though videos on YouTube usually get views but uploading directly on to Facebook would bring more viewership for your social media video.

### 3\. Keep your Facebook video short

Like text content, your Facebook Marketing video should also be crisp and short. Video with a fresh and fascinatingly entertaining content becomes a potential viral video.
