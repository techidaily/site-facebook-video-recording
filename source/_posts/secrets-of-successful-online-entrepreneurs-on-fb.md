#### 1\. Access to exclusive content through fan subscriptions

Fan subscriptions with gated content are great ways to monetize Facebook pages. At least 10,000 followers or 250+ returning viewers are required to monetize your Facebook page through subscriptions:

* Engagements on 50,000 posts
* Watching time of 180,000 minutes

![fan subscriptions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/A-Comprehensive-Guide-to-Monetize-Your-Facebook-Page-Tips-and-Tricks-4.jpg)

#### 2\. Facebook Ads

To monetize on Facebook, it is essential to use Facebook Ads. By using precision targeting, you are able to present your content, products, and services. The target demographic is the one who is most likely to engage or make a purchase. By doing so, advertising budgets can be used more efficiently and profits can be increased.

![facebook ads for facebook monetization](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/A-Comprehensive-Guide-to-Monetize-Your-Facebook-Page-Tips-and-Tricks-5.jpg)

#### 3\. Collabo Manager for Brands

Your brand will be more identifiable if you use this rather than in-stream ads. The more authentic your content is, the better your partnership will be. That's great! In order to get paid for creating content with brands, you must:

* Get to know Facebook's policies for monetizing partners and branded content.
* A minimum of 1,000 followers is required.
* In the last 60 days, you must have had at least 15,000 engagements or 180,000 minutes viewed.

Brand Collabs Manager is accessible once you meet these requirements.

#### 4\. Sell your products or services

Using videos on your Facebook page can help you sell more of your products and services. In addition, 54% of consumers want to see videos associated with your products.

Set up Facebook Shopping before you begin creating videos. The first thing you need to do is connect your e-commerce shop to Facebook. With Facebook Shops, you can offer your items to users directly on Facebook. You can make your Facebook dashboard template seamless, reduce friction, and increase conversions!

#### 5\. Stream live and monetize

A Facebook page can also be monetized through live streams. You can use stars to gift to your viewers when you go live, similar to how bits work on Twitch. Once you have those stars, you can exchange them for money. Other than making money, live streaming offers the advantage of repurposing your videos.

#### 6\. Make use of affiliate marketing links

Earn commissions by joining affiliate networks or brand programs. An affiliate commission is earned when Facebook users click the link or make a purchase.

### Tips and Best Practices to Implement these Strategies

* Your Facebook page should prioritize video content to boost traffic and engagement.
* Reach 10,000 followers and meet engagement criteria to monetize your page.
* For efficient budget management, use Facebook Ads with precision targeting.
* Meet set criteria when partnering with brands through the Brand Collabs Manager.
* For seamless shopping, use videos to showcase products and set up Facebook Shopping.
* Streams can be repurposed and viewers can buy stars.
* Earn commissions by clicking links and making purchases through affiliate programs.

#### 3\. Collabo Manager for Brands

Your brand will be more identifiable if you use this rather than in-stream ads. The more authentic your content is, the better your partnership will be. That's great! In order to get paid for creating content with brands, you must:

* Get to know Facebook's policies for monetizing partners and branded content.
* A minimum of 1,000 followers is required.
* In the last 60 days, you must have had at least 15,000 engagements or 180,000 minutes viewed.

Brand Collabs Manager is accessible once you meet these requirements.

#### 4\. Sell your products or services

Using videos on your Facebook page can help you sell more of your products and services. In addition, 54% of consumers want to see videos associated with your products.

Set up Facebook Shopping before you begin creating videos. The first thing you need to do is connect your e-commerce shop to Facebook. With Facebook Shops, you can offer your items to users directly on Facebook. You can make your Facebook dashboard template seamless, reduce friction, and increase conversions!

#### 5\. Stream live and monetize

A Facebook page can also be monetized through live streams. You can use stars to gift to your viewers when you go live, similar to how bits work on Twitch. Once you have those stars, you can exchange them for money. Other than making money, live streaming offers the advantage of repurposing your videos.

#### 6\. Make use of affiliate marketing links

Earn commissions by joining affiliate networks or brand programs. An affiliate commission is earned when Facebook users click the link or make a purchase.
