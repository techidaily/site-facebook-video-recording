* **Make it magical or animated:** Animated videos are the best magicians to provoke a magical touch. With just still images, they bring a new world alive before our eyes.
* **Showcase your product personality:** Video being dynamic than photos, **FB cover videos** are the best place to showcase your brand products and services.

### Conclusion

Thus, this Facebook cover video is an excellent add-on that proves to be an engaging tool in grabbing notice and spectators towards your account. Facebook being the first social media network to rock the floor, continues to be top on the line with additional features that are good-to-go!
