Cover videos have been a tactic to allure new customers into the offered product or service. To ensure that the developed video is of the highest of qualities, you need to look into the specifications of a basic or **animated Facebook cover,** as shown below.

### Size of the Cover Video

There are no specified sizes of cover videos uploaded across Facebook. Considering the basic limit of Facebook, the platform allows users to upload videos as larger as 1.75GB in size. Try to choose a file size that is within the basic limits. It is preferably advised to avoid such large video files as it gets difficult for users to view the video due to slow browsing speeds.

### Dimensions to Be Followed

Facebook has set a particular set of dimensions for a **Facebook banner video** that you create for your page or business. With the default requirements of 820 x 312 pixels, the optimal dimensions that are believed to be the perfect fit for a Facebook cover video are 820 x 462 pixels.

![dimension for facebook cover video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-cover-video-2.jpg)

You may consider using different cropping tools for managing the aspect ratio of your video. While calling out the use of this tool, the images and text of the video should be as centered as possible, saving them from being removed from the banner after cropping.

## Part 2: How to Set Up Your First Facebook Cover Video

Once you are made aware of all the important aspects of what makes a **Facebook header video** or an **animated Facebook cover,** it is time to take the responsibility of setting up the first Facebook cover video for your business. This part would feature the basic possibilities and procedural requirements to help users set up the first Facebook cover video.

The first and basic step of setting up the Facebook cover video is to have it uploaded across the platform. Before having it uploaded, ensure that the specifications of the cover video have been covered to perfection, with no particular loopholes within the video. Use the simple step-by-step procedure of uploading a Facebook video across the platform.

**Step 1:** Launch Facebook and access the page where the cover video will be uploaded. Access “Pages” from your news feed to look into the page.

**Step 3:** Select the video and upload it. You can reposition the video by dragging it up and down and tapping “Next.”

**Step 4:** You are advised to select the thumbnail out of the provided options. Furthermore, you are also provided with the option to select the ‘Automatically Replay Video in Loop’ button to keep the video playing in the loop. Once done, tap ‘Save Changes’ to conclude.

The second step of this process is the assurance of a successful video upload. Check the uploaded video across the mobile and desktop browsers to check how it looks across the devices. Make any changes within the video and re-upload it again, if required.

## Part 3: Make the Best Facebook Cover Video for your Business

The question comes over the basic tricks that should be followed to design a **Facebook banner video.** While looking for the best options for a Facebook cover video, a few tips effectively make a Facebook video look impressive to the users.

### Tips that Should Be Followed for the Best Facebook Cover Video

While creating an **animated Facebook cover** for your business, you need to look into some tips and tricks to be adopted to make it look great to the viewers. While realizing that the video should be short, simple, and comprehendible for the viewers, a few points should be reconsidered before finalizing a **Facebook banner video.**

* Make the most unique and exceptional idea out of an advert for your business's cover video. While understanding the professional approach to a Facebook cover video, design a cover video within the border of ethics and morality. Make it fun to watch; however, do not drag the basic idea elsewhere.
* The video that is uploaded across the platform should ensure that the starting and ending points of the video should end within a natural loop. With an auto playset for everyone to view, a Facebook cover video should be uploaded for the audience to see the latest update that you have related to your business.
* Reposition the text and images across your cover video to ensure that the cropped video does not involve any text or image. However, users should consider using the correct size of the Facebook cover video from the start.

### Solutions to Some Basic Issues Encountered by the Users While Uploading Facebook Cover Video

There are a few hindrances that the users counter once they upload or are within the process of uploading their Facebook cover video on the platform. This section features some quick solutions that can be adopted by users while setting up their **Facebook header video.**

* You need to look into your device and analyze that the latest operating system and an up-to-date browser have been installed across it. To ensure that the video lies within the specific range, it is important to fit the video within the right dimensions.
* The file sizes and specifications are to be followed to their root to gain the best results. Users who complain of not fitting their Facebook cover video to perfection are advised to go through the specifications before finalizing the video. However, it still fails to deliver; try to contact Facebook support over this concern.
* Make sure that the sound of the **Facebook banner video** is turned on.
