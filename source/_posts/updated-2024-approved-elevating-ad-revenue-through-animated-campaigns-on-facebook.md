### Targeting a Specific Audience

While setting up an advertisement, it is very important to understand the audience that will be interacting with the advertisement.

### Utilize Facebook Canvas Ads

Although an advertisement contains the appropriate videos, photos, GIFs, and call-to-actions, defining the style and format of the advertisement holds similar importance.

### Using Social Proof

Animated ads are not generally focused on adding realistic frames and videos within them. However, adding social proof across your ads makes them more relevant and acknowledged by the consumer.

However, with the use of retargeting campaigns, people who are generally aware of the tool or product can be allured back into the system with ads that would be highly interactive. However, users need to make sure that the message within the ad is still relevant to their cause and target audience.

### Creating Lookalikes of Your Audience

After setting up a proper target audience for your product or service, the user needs to proceed with setting up their lookalikes of the defined audience. Using such an approach is generally consistent and highly profitable, as this would help brands reach out to the problems of the audience and help them target the points that would effectively bring the attention of the viewer into the system.

### Do a Clear Analysis of the Competitors

It is quite important to be aware of what your competitors are up to. For this, an analysis of the ads of competitors is necessary. This would help you point out the reason that led to the success or failure of their advertisement. Following this, you would realize the factors that would help you ensure the success of your ad.
