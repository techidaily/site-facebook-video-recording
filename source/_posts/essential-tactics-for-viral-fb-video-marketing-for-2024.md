### 8\. Mobile friendly

Being the perfect partner to kill time, while waiting for someone, travelling alone, or in the queue in a supermarket, mobile phones certainly have more attention than other gadgets.

So, Facebook marketing videos need to cash on this aspect. These videos need to be mobile-friendly, means they have to be short and aligned to fit any mobile screen size without pixellating. Adverts that scored high for mobiles have the following aspects –

* Easy to understandable message, even without any audio.
* Most part of the video concentrates on the product or service.
* The visuals identify the brand clearly
* Voiceover supports the visuals.

### 10\. Add call to action

Adding a call to action in your video is vital. Without a call to action, viewers might watch and forget a video and the message you are conveying will be lost.

You need to build the base, ask them to like, share, or comment on your Facebook videos or even push them gently to visit your website, check out the products/service. You can add a link using goo.gl or bit.ly to cut-short the link and guide them for more information about your services.
