## Part 2: How to View Stories on Facebook Desktop?

You can use Facebook on your desktop; it is feasible to use it on a desktop when you are using it for professional purposes such as blogging or business. It is possible to view old Facebook stories through desktop also; here is how:

**Step 1: Log in and open story archives**

You can log in to Facebook on a desktop to proceed to watch your old stories. When you log in, you have to click on your profile picture to land on your profile page. From the menu bar beneath your profile picture, you have to click on **story archives**.

**Step 2: View old stories**

## Part 3: How to View A Friend’s Old Facebook Story?

It is nearly impossible to view your friend’s story once it has disappeared. You cannot watch the stories even if they are achieved. However, there is one way to view old stories of your friends. Here is how:

Step 1: Visit target profile

To view your friend’s old stories, you have to **visit your friend’s profile** by writing their name in the search bar.

**Step 2: View story highlights**

If your friend has selected the **highlights** option, which is a star emoji on the bottom left. The story will be saved, and you can view it after 24 hours.

**Step 3: Click on the right highlights**

People make a **series of highlights** and name them accordingly. If the story is about a wedding, people can name those stories’ **wedding highlights**. So, click on the highlight you want to view.

**Note:** A person or a user has to click on the star highlight sign to save stories for the future. If they do not select the highlight option, stories will disappear after 24 hours, and there is no way to view them in the future. Hence, this option is only applicable when a user has saved their stories for public view.
