Even if you play a video of 1080p resolution, Facebook controls the display settings. It is because the high-quality videos take longer to load. The display settings are tailored to low quality to be played without facing the buffering issue. It makes the video blurry.

### Video Compression

The ideal Facebook video size is 720p. Facebook compresses the video that plays a vital role in optimizing the storage space and sustaining the servers. It is one of the primary reasons **Facebook videos blurry Chrome.**

### Internet Instability

The Facebook videos offer good quality content depending upon the internet connection. The faster connection means the high-quality videos load quicker. Therefore, do check your connection if your concern is **why are my uploaded Facebook videos blurry.**

### Limited Space on Device

Another significant cause of **Facebook videos' blurry Android** is the storage space in the device. If your device offers limited memory, the videos appear pixelated, blurry, and scrambled.

## Part 2: How to Fix Blurry Facebook Videos on iPhone?

The question that will be addressed in this section is **why are my Facebook videos blurry iPhone**. It is essential to talk about methods that will help get rid of the problem. Following are some methods designed for iPhone.

### Method 1: Updating the Facebook App

### Method 2: Don't Share the Video Before Uploading

You can get ahead of blurry Facebook videos by avoiding their sharing on other platforms. When you send the video to WhatsApp, Messenger, or Viber, the video is compressed and loses its original quality. Therefore, when you upload the compressed video, you run into **FB videos blurry.**

However, there are free alternatives for safe video sharing. You can use iCloud, and if the sharing is between two iPhone users, Bluetooth offers its services.

### Fix 1: No Video Sharing on Any Platform

The first fix eliminates the concern "**Facebook videos blurry**" as it focuses on an important pointer. We often share the video before uploading it for multiple reasons, such as taking someone's opinion and getting positive feedback. But it interferes with the video quality and makes it scrambled.

The users are suggested to avoid sharing on other platforms. However, if you share the file via Bluetooth, Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox no video compression occurs, and the issue would be killed without surfacing.
