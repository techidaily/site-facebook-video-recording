### **Sharing Passwords**

The thumb rule is never to share your password with anyone. Unfortunately, certain people welcome the online breach by directly or indirectly sharing their login info.

![keep your facebook password safe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-hack-get-your-account-back-2.jpg)

In addition, many Facebook messages or people may ask about your password for some procedure and convince you. So, secure your account and always keep your login details to yourself.

### **You're not Logging out From all the Devices.**

You may have logged in via phone, PC, or public systems. Make sure to log out from all devices and never click on **Save my password** for this device. In case of doubt, you can log out from all devices by **log out from all devices** option in settings of Facebook.

### **No Security Updates**

No security updates and custom settings can make your account more prone to hacking. Secure your account with all new security updates.

### **Involving in Suspicious Activity**

Don't push yourself into unknown links, videos and never share private information with anyone on Facebook messenger. The Facebook video hack was widespread, and many people got caught in it. So, don't open links, videos, or play games that look unknown.
