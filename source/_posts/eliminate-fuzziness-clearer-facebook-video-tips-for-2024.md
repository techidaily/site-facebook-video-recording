## Part 3: How to Fix Scrambled Facebook Videos on Android?

The section is sketched out for you if you are an Android user. Whenever you run into a pixelated and scrambled video, you question yourself, "**why are Facebook videos scrambled**?" There are three methods to nip the issue in the bud once and for all.

### Fix 1: No Video Sharing on Any Platform

The first fix eliminates the concern "**Facebook videos blurry**" as it focuses on an important pointer. We often share the video before uploading it for multiple reasons, such as taking someone's opinion and getting positive feedback. But it interferes with the video quality and makes it scrambled.

The users are suggested to avoid sharing on other platforms. However, if you share the file via Bluetooth, Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox no video compression occurs, and the issue would be killed without surfacing.

### Method 2: Don't Share the Video Before Uploading

You can get ahead of blurry Facebook videos by avoiding their sharing on other platforms. When you send the video to WhatsApp, Messenger, or Viber, the video is compressed and loses its original quality. Therefore, when you upload the compressed video, you run into **FB videos blurry.**

However, there are free alternatives for safe video sharing. You can use iCloud, and if the sharing is between two iPhone users, Bluetooth offers its services.

### Method 3: Using Facebook's Camera

**How do you fix blurry videos on Facebook**? It is easy. The iPhone users are expected to use the default Facebook camera to upload the video. Most people find the default camera useless, but they are wrong. It means that the camera does offer high-resolution results in the final output.

## Part 3: How to Fix Scrambled Facebook Videos on Android?

The section is sketched out for you if you are an Android user. Whenever you run into a pixelated and scrambled video, you question yourself, "**why are Facebook videos scrambled**?" There are three methods to nip the issue in the bud once and for all.

### Fix 1: No Video Sharing on Any Platform

The first fix eliminates the concern "**Facebook videos blurry**" as it focuses on an important pointer. We often share the video before uploading it for multiple reasons, such as taking someone's opinion and getting positive feedback. But it interferes with the video quality and makes it scrambled.

The users are suggested to avoid sharing on other platforms. However, if you share the file via Bluetooth, Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox no video compression occurs, and the issue would be killed without surfacing.

### Fix 2: Accessing Facebook's Camera

Using Facebook's camera works in the long run if scrambled videos are ruining the video quality. It may not reduce the pixelated effect, but the user would immediately find out how the video will be displayed on the timeline.

### Fix 3: Facebook App Upgradation

The last feasible method revolves around updating the Facebook app to eliminate all the possible causes of occurrence of scrambled Facebook videos. The step-by-step guide to upgrade the Facebook app is given below:

**Step 1:** For starters, hold your Android phone and head to "Play Store." Click on "Manage Apps and Device" from your account options. There, you will find "Updates Available."
