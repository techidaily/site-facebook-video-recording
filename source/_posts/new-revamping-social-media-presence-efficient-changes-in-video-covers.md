Facebook lets its users [create a profile video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) up to 7 seconds in length. The animated profile video would only be visible to people who are looking at your profile page so you can rest assured that it isn’t going to appear on the News Feed of your friends or followers. In the steps given below, we would discuss how to create a cover for your Facebook profile video.

   1. Once you have updated to the latest version of Facebook on your iOS device, you need to open the FB app and tap the ‘More’ button in the bottom right.
