![where to find Facebook Ads Manager ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-ads-manager.jpg)

Click on the   **Ads**  tab, and the **Create** button to get started. You can’t miss it - it’s **bright green**! You’ll be asked if you want to choose Guided Creation or Quick Creation. Either way is pretty easy to do, and you can experiment with both when you begin to see which works best for you.

![Facebook Campaign Creation Guide Types ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-do-you-want-to-create-ad-campaigns.jpg)

In the following part, I’ll show you the steps after clicking Select Guided Creation for detailed explanation.

Depending on what exactly you want to achieve from your ad, you’ll select a particular objective. Each one aims to help you reach your goal - whether that’s video views, leading people to your website, or getting them to buy your product. Depending on the objective you choose, your pricing could be different.

You will also be promoted to specify an audience that you want your ad to target. You’ll have to select info such as location, age, and demographic. This is especially important if you work in a specific area or with specific people - this way, your ad won’t target anybody who has no chance of being a potential client. Once you’ve got that out the way, you can look at doing the actual creation work.

#### 2. Choosing A Format

Once you’ve gone through the initial info, you need to choose a format for your ad. You have a few specific options to choose from:

### Tips & Tricks to Consider when creating video ads for Facebook

If you’ve never made a video ad using the Facebook Video Creation Kit before, there are some things that you should consider when creating your masterpiece:

* 85% of viewers keep the sound off in videos
* 47% of the value of a video ad is in the first three seconds
* The optimal length for videos are 15 seconds or shorter

Therefore, when creating your video, here are some things you should think about in order to make your ad as effective as possible:

* **Focus on visuals, not sound**

Use high-quality images (1280 x 720 pixels), and make sure they’re consistent in size and aspect ratio, or they will be automatically cropped. If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.

If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.

* **Get your point across ASAP**

Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.

* **Keep it short**

Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds. Remember - your viewer is likely to have many things vying for their attention - if you can hold onto it for 15 seconds, that’s success!

### Tips & Tricks to Consider when creating video ads for Facebook

If you’ve never made a video ad using the Facebook Video Creation Kit before, there are some things that you should consider when creating your masterpiece:

* 85% of viewers keep the sound off in videos
* 47% of the value of a video ad is in the first three seconds
* The optimal length for videos are 15 seconds or shorter

Therefore, when creating your video, here are some things you should think about in order to make your ad as effective as possible:

* **Focus on visuals, not sound**

Use high-quality images (1280 x 720 pixels), and make sure they’re consistent in size and aspect ratio, or they will be automatically cropped. If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.

If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.

* **Get your point across ASAP**

Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.

* **Keep it short**

Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds. Remember - your viewer is likely to have many things vying for their attention - if you can hold onto it for 15 seconds, that’s success!

### Bonus: Why you should place Video Ads on Facebook?
