 To celebrate its 10th anniversary, Facebook recently launched a [Look Back Page](https://www.facebook.com/lookback). If you visit that page, Facebook's algorithm will auto-generate a video of your profile history. It will show the year you joined Facebook, your most-liked photos, statuses with the most engagement, accompanied with a standard piece of music.

 It's pretty cool. But unfortunately, Facebook’s choice of pictures isn't. You may have to see some embarrassing old photos, or status updates that were funny at the time. In that case, you need to select the pictures of your choice, right?

 The good new is that, Facebook has introduced a new editor now, which lets you choose your favorite images for the video. To edit the Look Back video, simply hit the "Edit" button on the top right corner of the Look Back page. Then un-check the photos and updates you don't want in your video, and check the ones that you want include. Once you're done, click the green "Share Your Movie" button at the top of the page.

![edit look back video](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/edit-look-back-video.png "edit look back video")

 Now you've selected the image you like. But what if the result is still disappointing? Don't worry! Here I'll introduce you a more powerful video editing tool to edit and enrich your Facebook Look Back video. Read on to get more information.
