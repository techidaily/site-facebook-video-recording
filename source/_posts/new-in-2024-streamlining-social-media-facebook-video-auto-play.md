While realizing the purpose of autoplay across Facebook videos, the user can specify several options to make the feature effective according to their requirements. When using the Autoplay feature on Facebook, users can set four different options according to their discretion. To make the tool effective, you can set it up across mobile data and Wi-Fi. However, you can turn towards the Wi-Fi-only option to save the internet.

The autoplay feature is not a mandatory option for users to manage. This feature can be easily turned off, giving people control over what and what not to play. On the other hand, using **autoplay on Facebook** also provides users with playing the video with sound. However, this is completely under the hands of the user, who select the best option according to their requirements.

Following this, **Facebook autoplay** potentially works if the device's battery is up and running. Facebook automatically turns off this option to optimize battery life on a low battery.

## Part 2: Guide on How to Autoplay Facebook Videos

This part provides users with a guide on autoplay a video on Facebook across multiple devices. Being an Android, iOS, or Chrome user, you can look into any of the following step-by-step guides to get a clear knowledge of using autoplay across Facebook.

## Part 3: How Autoplay Feature Can Bother You in Using Facebook?

**Facebook autoplay** is a very useful tool that can be effective in many ways for users. However, there are some drawbacks to utilizing this feature. Some users do not prefer turning this feature across their devices for specific reasons. To understand why **autoplay on Facebook** can bother you, you need to look across the following reasons in detail.

### Putting in Awkward Situations

**Facebook video autoplay** makes video run automatically while scrolling down the platform. There are several instances where you may feel uneasy about listening to sounds after every other video passes by. For example, if you are sitting in a library and going through Facebook for some reason, the sound of the video can surely make things very awkward for you.

It is highly advisable that users can turn off the autoplay feature under such circumstances, as it would allow them to stay out of situations that would make them confused while sitting anywhere.

### Use of Data

There are cases where the autoplay feature across Facebook is turned on in conditions that consume unnecessary mobile phone data. If you have restricted access to mobile data with a limit, having the feature turned on across mobile data would even consume MBs, putting you in complicated situations.

In other cases, this can potentially cost your extra mobile services, which can turn out to be monetarily expensive.

### Consumption of Battery

The mobile data turned on across your device can consume your battery faster. The unnecessary play of the video consumes the battery and can leave you in situations where you may not have any access to a battery source. To avoid discrepancies under such circumstances, it is advised to turn off the **Facebook autoplay** feature as it would save battery for you, keeping your device turned on for a longer time.
