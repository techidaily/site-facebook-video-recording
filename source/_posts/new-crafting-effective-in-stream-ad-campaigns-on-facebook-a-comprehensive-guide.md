### Insights in Creator Studio

From this tab, you get to see the information related to your Pages, earnings, Facebook content, etc. There are two different levels of detail. Either you can view the Page-Level or the Video-Level Insights. Page-level insights include the following factors.

**Audience:** Here, you can take a deeper look at your viewers, your followers. You can also view a demographic breakdown.

**Overview**: Here, you can see an overview of the Page, performance, new followers, net followers, etc. You can also find the summary of Insights for each Page.

After this, let us share with you Video Level insights and the factors that are included in them.

### Understand Estimated Earning

You get Insights from the videos you upload or the videos your share on your Facebook Pages. Whereas the amount you earn from the ads in your videos is Estimated earnings. Let us dig deep.

**Estimated Earning**s: The amount one earns from ads in videos is known as Estimated Earnings. It depends on the CPM of the ads and also on the number of impressions.

**Ad CPM**: CPM is affected by the advertisers that want to reach your viewers, demographics of your audience, and also the time of the year. It is the reflection of what the advertisers are willing to pay.

**1 Minute Video Views**: This includes the total number of views on your video with ads within 1 minute or longer. 1-minute video view is important for monetization.

**Monetizable View RPM**: This is referred to as the amount you earn when your video with instream ads is viewed for more than a minute every 1000 times.
