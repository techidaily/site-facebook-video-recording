## Part 3\. Share Facebook Live Screen on Desktop

It can be easier to stream live from your desktop. Just remember to use a wired connection to secure your internet. This can help keep your stream live without any interruptions. You can kick back and watch Facebook live with friends. If you're the one creating the stream, then let's go. Let's look at how we can share Facebook live screen on desktop.

**Step 1:** Log in to Facebook using your credentials. Once you're logged in, go to the home page. On the home page, look for the 'Create Posts' option. You can see the option to create 'Live,' 'Event,' 'Jobs,' and more underneath this.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Step 2:** Choose 'live video' from that list of options. This will open a new page with two choices. You can choose to 'Go Live.' Alternatively, you can also choose to 'Create live video events.' Creating a live event gives your audience a chance to engage with you by responding to the event. Facebook also sends a reminder about the event before the schedule.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Step 3:** You can choose to 'Go Live.' This means you can simply go live for a casual update. It comes with the ability to add interactivity tools for your Facebook audience. You can preview how your live stream is going to look. This is done by using the 'Create a test broadcast before going live' button. Toggle it on and click on 'Select.'

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Step 4:** Regardless of if you choose to go live or choose a test broadcast, you'll go to the "Stream Setup" page. This page gives you many options on how to set up your stream. Look at the left-side panel options. You can choose which camera you want as your input source. Select the microphone you want to use on the page. Below the microphone icon is the button for 'Start Screen Share.'

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Step 5:** Once you click on 'Start Screen Share,' a new dialog box pops open. It gives you the option of sharing' Entire Screen.', 'Window,' or 'Chrome Tabs.

**Step 6:** Under the 'Entire Screen' option, you can share the current window open as 'Screen 1'. You can also share your desktop background if you choose. This shows up as 'Screen 2'. Once you've made your choice, tap on the 'Share' button. This creates a "Post Preview." You can see what the post will look like when it goes live. Click on 'Next' on the bottom left of the screen to continue.

![fill in title on facebook live video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-13.png)

**Step 7:** Simply fill out the live stream post details on the left side panel. Fill out details like the live stream title in the 'Title Required' box. You can add additional descriptions in the prompt box beneath the title box. Click on 'Next' when you're done filling in the details.

**Step 8:** You'll now see the Dashboard. Beneath the Dashboard, you can spot the 'Go Live' button. Once you're happy with the live video setup, you can click on the 'Go Live' button. The live video is set up with a countdown from three to one. Your video then goes live.
