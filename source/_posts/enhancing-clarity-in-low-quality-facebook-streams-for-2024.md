### Method 3: Using Facebook's Camera

**How do you fix blurry videos on Facebook**? It is easy. The iPhone users are expected to use the default Facebook camera to upload the video. Most people find the default camera useless, but they are wrong. It means that the camera does offer high-resolution results in the final output.

## Part 3: How to Fix Scrambled Facebook Videos on Android?

The section is sketched out for you if you are an Android user. Whenever you run into a pixelated and scrambled video, you question yourself, "**why are Facebook videos scrambled**?" There are three methods to nip the issue in the bud once and for all.

### Fix 1: No Video Sharing on Any Platform

The first fix eliminates the concern "**Facebook videos blurry**" as it focuses on an important pointer. We often share the video before uploading it for multiple reasons, such as taking someone's opinion and getting positive feedback. But it interferes with the video quality and makes it scrambled.

The users are suggested to avoid sharing on other platforms. However, if you share the file via Bluetooth, Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox no video compression occurs, and the issue would be killed without surfacing.

### Video Compression

The ideal Facebook video size is 720p. Facebook compresses the video that plays a vital role in optimizing the storage space and sustaining the servers. It is one of the primary reasons **Facebook videos blurry Chrome.**

### Internet Instability

The Facebook videos offer good quality content depending upon the internet connection. The faster connection means the high-quality videos load quicker. Therefore, do check your connection if your concern is **why are my uploaded Facebook videos blurry.**

### Limited Space on Device

Another significant cause of **Facebook videos' blurry Android** is the storage space in the device. If your device offers limited memory, the videos appear pixelated, blurry, and scrambled.

## Part 2: How to Fix Blurry Facebook Videos on iPhone?
