Even if you play a video of 1080p resolution, Facebook controls the display settings. It is because the high-quality videos take longer to load. The display settings are tailored to low quality to be played without facing the buffering issue. It makes the video blurry.

### Video Compression

The ideal Facebook video size is 720p. Facebook compresses the video that plays a vital role in optimizing the storage space and sustaining the servers. It is one of the primary reasons **Facebook videos blurry Chrome.**

### Internet Instability

The Facebook videos offer good quality content depending upon the internet connection. The faster connection means the high-quality videos load quicker. Therefore, do check your connection if your concern is **why are my uploaded Facebook videos blurry.**

### Method 2: Don't Share the Video Before Uploading

However, there are free alternatives for safe video sharing. You can use iCloud, and if the sharing is between two iPhone users, Bluetooth offers its services.
