 Finally you have to update the ‘About’ section of your profile. Add your contact information, gender, age, and religion as well as relationship status as per your choice. Update few attractive quotes to make it more interesting.

#### Step 7.Find your Friends

**Search:** You will find a search bar on the top of screen, enter name of your friends over there and as soon as you find them hit the “send friend request” button.
