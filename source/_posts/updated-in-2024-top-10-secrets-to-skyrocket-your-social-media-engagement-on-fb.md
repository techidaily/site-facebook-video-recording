### 2. Optimize Page URL

 For Facebook SEO, you need to have a [custom URL same as your brand name](https://www.weebly.com/seo/url). It eventually promotes brand recognition and makes users remember your brand. Unless you create a custom URL for your Facebook page, Facebook might auto-generate a long and tough to memorize URL. Using ‘Page Info’ under your Facebook page’s ‘About’ section, access the ‘Create Page @username’ and create the username. Set the brand name in place of username and you are good to go.

### 3. Optimize company profile

 While doing SEO for Facebook page, not every brand optimizes their company profile online. But, it is crucial to optimize and encourage growth of the Facebook fan page for their brands.

### 4. Optimize Facebook Notes

 Facebook Notes are utilized to create engagement and inform your fans about important business related news, current crisis or upcoming events. These Notes get indexed post search by Google for business profile only. Through them, you can add keyword rich content and improve the fan page ranks in Google and Bing. Photos as well as the title and Note contain keywords within the caption. After adding captions to your Notes, if users comment in it, then the chances to rank higher increases. If the comments too have keywords as well, the Notes gains more value, attracting engagement and tags.

### 6. Post Fresh Content

 Fresh, keyword optimized, quality content is important for social media as well as website pages for any brand. It applies to Facebook equally. Unique content helps your brand rank better, but at times you run out of content ideas. Using influencer marketing, you can add fresh content with a new tone to your content marketing drives. Guest posts, product review, and campaigns on social media takeover can help your business to a great extent. Influencers propel their followers for creating unique content for your business. Through hashtags, they might ask their followers to tag them and your brand as well in social media campaigns or share their experiences.

### 7. Make Business time Accurate

 Mentioning the business times on your Facebook page is important. In case it changes, you need to immediately update it. Moreover, new location page additions along with correct operational hours and days should be mentioned too. Facebook doesn’t have the feature to allow you customizing hours for special events or holidays, but you can use Facebook posts and advertising to meet that need.

Along with photo, you can also add a video or a slideshow in the featured image/banner section. Testimonials, team credits can be promoted in this section.
