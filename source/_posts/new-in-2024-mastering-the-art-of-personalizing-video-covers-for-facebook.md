## How to Create Video Cover in Facebook Profile

Facebook lets its users [create a profile video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) up to 7 seconds in length.

In the steps given below, we would discuss how to create a cover for your Facebook profile video.

   1. Once you have updated to the latest version of Facebook on your iOS device, you need to open the FB app and tap the ‘More’ button in the bottom right.
