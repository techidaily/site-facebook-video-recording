We often find ourselves in a situation where we see something funny or interesting on YouTube and immediately want to share it on our Facebook.</p><p>We can easily share YouTube videos on Facebook. Here is the complete guide on sharing youtube videos on Facebook.</p><p>However, when you share something from YouTube to Facebook, it adds an embed link, and the video does not support autoplay on Facebook.</p><p>So, to help you avoid that problem, we will give you a step-by-step guide in this article.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to Turn Facebook Video Autoplay On&#x2F;Off?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-I-Play-YouTube-Videos-Automatically-on-Facebook"><a href="#Part-1-Can-I-Play-YouTube-Videos-Automatically-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?"></a>Part 1: Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?</h2><p>The YouTube videos that you share on Facebook do not play automatically. Facebook does not give the privilege to YouTube to play videos on their platform.</p><p>Thus, when you share a YouTube video on Facebook, it shows in the form of a link instead of a video player.</p><p>Now the question is, what can you do?</p><p>There are two ways you can go about in order to enable the autoplay feature for your YouTube videos.</p><h3 id="First-Method"><a href="#First-Method" class="headerlink" title="First Method"></a>First Method</h3><p>The first method that we will introduce here is for those who have a YouTube channel of their own and want to transfer their videos from YouTube to Facebook and enable autoplay.</p><p>The unfortunate thing is that YouTube does not have a feature that allows you to share videos as videos instead of an embed link. So, we look at third-party apps for help.</p><p>One of such third-party apps is TubeBuddy. It is an amazing app for YouTube Channel Management that we will use here to solve our little problem.</p><p>We will now provide you with a step-by-step guide for uploading your YouTube videos to Facebook with the help of TubeBuddy.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Go to your YouTube Channel</strong></p><p>The first step is to go to your YouTube channel and select the video you want to share.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-1.jpg"                      alt="Go to the YouTube channel and select the video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Go to the TubeBuddy Dropdown Menu</strong></p><p>Click on the TubeBuddy Dropdown menu. You will see a lot of different tabs here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-2.jpg"                      alt="Click on the TubeBuddy Dropdown menu."                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Look for the Syndicate Option</strong></p><p>In the drop-down menu, look for the Syndicate tab. Under it, click on “Publish to Facebook” to transfer the video to your Facebook page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-3.jpg"                      alt="search for the Syndicate tab to “Publish video on Facebook”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Set the Desired Settings</strong></p><p>A dialog box will appear where you can enter your Facebook account, set the title, adjust the description, set the publish time, and set the thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-4.jpg"                      alt="Set the Desired Settings"                ></p><p>Once you are done, click on “Publish to Facebook,” and voila!</p><p>Now, your YouTube video will be uploaded on your Facebook page as a video and will play automatically as the rest of the Facebook videos do.</p><h3 id="Second-Method"><a href="#Second-Method" class="headerlink" title="Second Method"></a>Second Method</h3><p>The second method of ensuring the autoplay feature works with your videos is to upload them directly from your computer. You can also download videos from YouTube using third-party services and then upload them on Facebook.</p><p>The step-by-step guide is given below.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Search and Open the Video</strong></p><p>Go to YouTube, search for the video you want to share on Facebook, and open it.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Copy the URL</strong></p><p>At the top of the page, copy the URL of the page.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Use Any Third-Party Service</strong></p><p>Some different third-party apps and websites help you convert and download YouTube videos. Just a quick Google search will help you out with finding one.</p><p>Paste the URL in the app or website. Then download the video.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Upload the Video to Facebook.</strong></p><p>Once you have the video on your computer, go to Facebook. On the home page, you will see an option to upload a Photo&#x2F;Video below the status bar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-5.jpg"                      alt="Status bar"                ></p><p>Click on it, select the video you want to upload, and then post it.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>You can use this particular method for uploading any video that you have on your computer.

We often find ourselves in a situation where we see something funny or interesting on YouTube and immediately want to share it on our Facebook.</p><p>We can easily share YouTube videos on Facebook. Here is the complete guide on sharing youtube videos on Facebook.</p><p>However, when you share something from YouTube to Facebook, it adds an embed link, and the video does not support autoplay on Facebook.</p><p>So, to help you avoid that problem, we will give you a step-by-step guide in this article.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to Turn Facebook Video Autoplay On&#x2F;Off?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-I-Play-YouTube-Videos-Automatically-on-Facebook-3"><a href="#Part-1-Can-I-Play-YouTube-Videos-Automatically-on-Facebook-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?"></a>Part 1: Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?</h2><p>The YouTube videos that you share on Facebook do not play automatically. Facebook does not give the privilege to YouTube to play videos on their platform.</p><p>Thus, when you share a YouTube video on Facebook, it shows in the form of a link instead of a video player.</p><p>Now the question is, what can you do?</p><p>There are two ways you can go about in order to enable the autoplay feature for your YouTube videos.</p><h3 id="First-Method-3"><a href="#First-Method-3" class="headerlink" title="First Method"></a>First Method</h3><p>The first method that we will introduce here is for those who have a YouTube channel of their own and want to transfer their videos from YouTube to Facebook and enable autoplay.</p><p>The unfortunate thing is that YouTube does not have a feature that allows you to share videos as videos instead of an embed link. So, we look at third-party apps for help.</p><p>One of such third-party apps is TubeBuddy. It is an amazing app for YouTube Channel Management that we will use here to solve our little problem.</p><p>We will now provide you with a step-by-step guide for uploading your YouTube videos to Facebook with the help of TubeBuddy.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Go to your YouTube Channel</strong></p><p>The first step is to go to your YouTube channel and select the video you want to share.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-1.jpg"                      alt="Go to the YouTube channel and select the video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Go to the TubeBuddy Dropdown Menu</strong></p><p>Click on the TubeBuddy Dropdown menu. You will see a lot of different tabs here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-2.jpg"                      alt="Click on the TubeBuddy Dropdown menu."                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Look for the Syndicate Option</strong></p><p>In the drop-down menu, look for the Syndicate tab. Under it, click on “Publish to Facebook” to transfer the video to your Facebook page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-3.jpg"                      alt="search for the Syndicate tab to “Publish video on Facebook”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Set the Desired Settings</strong></p><p>A dialog box will appear where you can enter your Facebook account, set the title, adjust the description, set the publish time, and set the thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-4.jpg"                      alt="Set the Desired Settings"                ></p><p>Once you are done, click on “Publish to Facebook,” and voila!</p><p>Now, your YouTube video will be uploaded on your Facebook page as a video and will play automatically as the rest of the Facebook videos do.</p><h3 id="Second-Method-3"><a href="#Second-Method-3" class="headerlink" title="Second Method"></a>Second Method</h3><p>The second method of ensuring the autoplay feature works with your videos is to upload them directly from your computer. You can also download videos from YouTube using third-party services and then upload them on Facebook.</p><p>The step-by-step guide is given below.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Search and Open the Video</strong></p><p>Go to YouTube, search for the video you want to share on Facebook, and open it.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Copy the URL</strong></p><p>At the top of the page, copy the URL of the page.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Use Any Third-Party Service</strong></p><p>Some different third-party apps and websites help you convert and download YouTube videos. Just a quick Google search will help you out with finding one.</p><p>Paste the URL in the app or website. Then download the video.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Upload the Video to Facebook.</strong></p><p>Once you have the video on your computer, go to Facebook. On the home page, you will see an option to upload a Photo&#x2F;Video below the status bar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-5.jpg"                      alt="Status bar"                ></p><p>Click on it, select the video you want to upload, and then post it.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>You can use this particular method for uploading any video that you have on your computer.

In this post, we will tell you how to do Facebook video marketing.</p><h2 id="10-tips-for-Facebook-video-marketing"><a href="#10-tips-for-Facebook-video-marketing" class="headerlink" title="10 tips for Facebook video marketing"></a>10 tips for Facebook video marketing</h2><h3 id="1-Facebook-Live-video-is-a-trend"><a href="#1-Facebook-Live-video-is-a-trend" class="headerlink" title="1. Facebook Live video is a trend"></a>1. Facebook Live video is a trend</h3><p>Since last year, the average time for consuming Facebook Live videos has increased four-fold. Reports from Facebook’s research reveal that video content is consumed five times more than static content by the users.</p><p>Facebook Live has taken things to a new level. As soon as you go live on Facebook, your friends and followers&#x2F;subscribers get notifications automatically.</p><p>Facebook video marketing seems great where you can live interact with your consumers about your products&#x2F;services or a promotional event. You get feedbacks, suggestions for improvements, or outright praise from them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-live-iphone.JPG"                      alt="facebook live video"                ></p><h3 id="2-Upload-Videos-Directly-to-Facebook-rather-than-YouTube"><a href="#2-Upload-Videos-Directly-to-Facebook-rather-than-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="2. Upload Videos Directly to Facebook rather than YouTube"></a>2. Upload Videos Directly to Facebook rather than YouTube</h3><p>Though videos on YouTube usually get views but uploading directly on to Facebook would bring more viewership for your social media video.</p><p>Videos on Facebook perform better than other platforms for video sharing denotes a popular source. Apart from that compared to photo and other graphic posts, videos receive a whopping 135% higher organic search on Facebook.</p><p>Facebook marketing videos are becoming the strongest confidants of business owners nowadays due to these facts.</p><p>The default auto-play feature even makes things lot better, as people stop by to watch at least 5-6 seconds of the video while scrolling down and get hooked to it, without even searching for it.</p><p>The video view counter helps you estimate the way your viral video fared. You can understand users’ behavior to understand their needs and what can you do to bring them to you again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-video-to-facebook.JPG"                      alt="upload video to facebook"                ></p><h3 id="3-Keep-your-Facebook-video-short"><a href="#3-Keep-your-Facebook-video-short" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep your Facebook video short"></a>3. Keep your Facebook video short</h3><p>Like text content, your Facebook Marketing video should also be crisp and short. Video with a fresh and fascinatingly entertaining content becomes a potential viral video. Creating them in widely used language (such as English) would garner more popularity sans the cultural or geographical background of a person.</p><p>Shorter videos between 2 minutes effectively perform in comparison to longer versions. But, ensure that the gist of your message should be delivered within that time frame. Make the video so understandable and connecting, that words just add charm to it and not solely define it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-video-length.JPG"                      alt="facebook video short"                ></p><h3 id="4-Shoot-Facebook-video-vertically"><a href="#4-Shoot-Facebook-video-vertically" class="headerlink" title="4. Shoot Facebook video vertically"></a>4. Shoot Facebook video vertically</h3><p>A majority of Facebook users watch videos on their mobile phone or tablets. So shooting your social media video in vertical mode is pleasing to the eyes, while viewing it on a mobile. Portrait (vertically-aligned) videos have a better hit rate compared to horizontal shots. Keeping that in mind, make sure to create your new videos in a mobile friendly manner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-video-vertical.JPG"                      alt="facebook vidoe vertical"                ></p><h3 id="5-Feature-a-Video-on-Facebook-Page"><a href="#5-Feature-a-Video-on-Facebook-Page" class="headerlink" title="5. Feature a Video on Facebook Page"></a>5. Feature a Video on Facebook Page</h3><p>Just like featured photos on the about section of your Facebook page, you can add your Facebook marketing video as a featured video. When people love your video they keep on sharing it to their near and dear ones, be it about anything.</p><p>It will make your video get popular and go viral as well in case it gets shared fast in a large number. Ensure that the video has a prominent thumbnail on your about page.</p><p>You can use it to promote an event, launch a product or service, or a teaser about some upcoming surprises. The clearer it gets on your page, the more clicks you will get from the audience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/feature-video-facebook.JPG"                      alt="feature video facebook"                ></p><h3 id="6-Carefully-choose-thumbnail"><a href="#6-Carefully-choose-thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="6. Carefully choose thumbnail"></a>6. Carefully choose thumbnail</h3><p>Well! We have just said about the thumbnail on your Facebook video. The social media video you upload on Facebook will garner more viewership with a suitable and attractive thumbnail.</p><p>When there is a weak internet connection, the videos on Facebook might not auto-play; they would display a static image there. Don’t exceed the 90 characters Ad copy limit for the thumbnail, in case your video has text on it. Try to keep it as less as you can to adhere to Facebook’s 20% text policy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-thumbnail.JPG"                      alt="facebook thumbnail"                ></p><h3 id="7-Leverage-Facebook-360-Videos"><a href="#7-Leverage-Facebook-360-Videos" class="headerlink" title="7. Leverage Facebook 360 Videos"></a>7. Leverage Facebook 360 Videos</h3><p>Facebook introduced 360 videos are a rage among the users. Keeping virtual reality in mind, Facebook launched this feature to improve communication and social interaction.</p><p>With a social media video shot with Facebook 360-degree feature, your viewers will connect more with your story and the experience you are sharing. For shooting an event and taking panoramic views 360-videos serve the best result.</p><p>These videos can be rotated, paned, and can be viewed from any angle they desire. They are loved 40 percent more than the traditional videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-360-video.JPG"                      alt="facebook 360 video"                ></p><h3 id="8-Mobile-friendly"><a href="#8-Mobile-friendly" class="headerlink" title="8. Mobile friendly"></a>8. Mobile friendly</h3><p>Being the perfect partner to kill time, while waiting for someone, travelling alone, or in the queue in a supermarket, mobile phones certainly have more attention than other gadgets.</p><p>So, Facebook marketing videos need to cash on this aspect.

Adverts that scored high for mobiles have the following aspects –</p><ul><li>Easy to understandable message, even without any audio.</li><li>Most part of the video concentrates on the product or service.</li><li>The visuals identify the brand clearly</li><li>Voiceover supports the visuals.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mobile-users.JPG"                      alt="mobile friendly"                ></p><h3 id="9-Posting-time-is-important"><a href="#9-Posting-time-is-important" class="headerlink" title="9. Posting time is important"></a>9. Posting time is important</h3><p>Knowing the right time to post your social media video on Facebook or any other social media platform is vital.</p><p>People from diverse backgrounds or field of work consume different video content. You might have heard that Wednesdays are great for business related videos.</p><p>There are tools to study the statistics and analyze the most favorable time for posting your Facebook marketing video. You can use them to determine what’s your time to post and get more viewership.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-posting-time.JPG"                      alt="facebook posting time"                ></p><h3 id="10-Add-call-to-action"><a href="#10-Add-call-to-action" class="headerlink" title="10.

You can add a link using goo.gl or bit.ly to cut-short the link and guide them for more information about your services.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-call-to-action.JPG"                      alt="facebook call to action"                ></p><h3 id="11-Choose-a-suitable-video-creator"><a href="#11-Choose-a-suitable-video-creator" class="headerlink" title="11.

Being a versatile social media application, there is one feature that makes it even better: the ability to upload stories. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Facebook stories <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stay for only 24 hours, which is good if you want to upload a quick photo, video or write something that reflects your current status. Other than posting pictures on your profile that stay for everyone to see for as long as you want, stories work a bit differently, which is it lasts only for 24 hours and vanishes automatically.</p><p>Just like you can upload something on your story for others to see, you can also see others’ stories. This brings us to the question if there is a way to view someone’s stories without letting them know that you have checked them out? Well, yes, you can <strong>view Facebook stories anonymously</strong> by following a few tricks. What happens is that when you check someone’s story, they can check who has viewed it. Then, to view the stories, you need to go to the home page and click on any story on the top that you want to see. Since you want to become the anonymous <strong>Facebook story viewer,</strong> let’s find some techniques to do that.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to View Someone’s Facebook Story Anonymously</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook Normally</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Check Who Have Seen My Facebook Story</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs About Viewing Facebook Story</a></li></ul><hr><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

[4 Ways]"></a>Part 1: How to View Someone’s Facebook Story Anonymously? [4 Ways]</h2><h3 id="Method-1-Turn-on-the-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Method-1-Turn-on-the-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Turn on the Airplane Mode"></a>Method 1: Turn on the Airplane Mode</h3><p>When you turn on the airplane mode of your device, your phone will no longer be connected to the internet. So, what happens is that when the Airplane Mode is enabled, and you check a story, Facebook will fail to register your account as one of the <strong>Facebook story viewers.</strong> This is a pretty easy technique. Here’s how you need to apply this method.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your iOS or Android device’s Facebook account. Once you are there, log in using your credentials, and then you will see the home page and, on the top, will be the stories of different people.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, turn on the airplane mode to go offline, and then open the home page again and click on any story you want to see. The story will begin to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-facebook-story-anonymously-via-offline.jpg"                      alt="View Facebok Story anonymously via offline"                ></p><p>Once you are done, force close the Facebook application so that it doesn’t run in the background when you disable the Airplane Mode. Because if you do that, your name can get registered. So, close the app completely. Please note that when the Airplane mode is on, some stories will not load. To watch them, you need to turn on and off the airplane mode again.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Half-Swipe"><a href="#Method-2-Half-Swipe" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Half Swipe"></a>Method 2: Half Swipe</h3><p>As the name suggests, rather than watching the entire story, you need to stop watching it halfway through. The only apparent disadvantage of this method is you won’t be able to see the whole story. The step that you will have to follow will be similar to watching a story normally. Follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Facebook application and click on any of the stories.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While viewing, put the finger on the story right before the story is about to end.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Quickly swipe right or left and make sure the story doesn’t end. This way, Facebook won’t register you.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Block-Them"><a href="#Method-3-Block-Them" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Block Them"></a>Method 3: Block Them</h3><p>This is another method to stop appearing as one of the viewers. This method will let you view the whole story; however, since it involves blocking the user, they will be removed from your friend list completely. So, try it if only you are fine with removing that person from your friends’ list. Here’s how to follow this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook account and log in, and then <strong>c</strong>lick on the story that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once done, block the person. If you want, you can unblock them after 24 hours.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously"><a href="#Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously"></a>Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously</h3><p>For the last resort, you can deactivate your account and reactivate it after a while so that your name doesn’t appear on the viewer’s list. Even though this is an extreme step to take, but it keeps you anonymous. So, here’s how you can do this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log in to your Facebook account and log in and then click on the story or stories that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the three dots on the top right, then select the Settings and Privacy option, click on the Privacy Shortcuts option.</p><p> <strong>Step 3:</strong> You will see the Delete Your Account option. Please click on that. Two options will be available: deactivate your account and delete your account. You need to click on the deactivate option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deactivate-facebook-account.jpg"                      alt="deactivate FB account to View Facebok Story anonymously"                ></p><p>Once 24 hours is over, you can log in to reactive your account.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-See-Someone’s-Story-on-Facebook"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-See-Someone’s-Story-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook?"></a>Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook?</h2><p>There are three easy ways to see someone’s story on Facebook.

This is known as <strong>Facebook story viewers.</strong> This option will be available on your story. Here’s how to check Facebook story viewers.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your Facebook account on a browser or launch the mobile app, whichever works for you. And then click on the Your Story option.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, click on the viewers’ option that you see towards the bottom left.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-who-viewed-facebook-story.jpg"                      alt="View who have seen my Facebok Story"                ></p><p>Now, you can see the list of people’s names who have seen your story.

If your account is public, you will also have the other viewer option, which will show you the number of unknown people who viewed your story. But unfortunately, it doesn’t show you who they are.</p><ol><li><strong>Can I see how many times someone views my Facebook story?</strong></li></ol><p>Currently, Facebook doesn’t have the feature to show how many times someone has viewed your Facebook story. The only thing you can check is who viewed the story.</p><ol><li><strong>What Does “Other Viewers” Mean on Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>Other viewers option appears only on the public accounts. So, when you upload a story on your public profile, it becomes visible for everyone to see. But you can change it by limiting the viewer to friends only. But if there is an “other viewer” option available, it means that someone other than the people in your friend list has seen your story too.</p><ol><li><strong>How to tell if someone has seen my Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>To know whether someone has seen your Facebook story or not, simply click on your story and tap on the viewer’s option. You will have a list of people who checked your story.</p><ol><li><strong>How can I save someone’s Facebook Story after viewing it?</strong></li></ol><p>If you want to save someone’s Facebook story, you can get the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Story Saver for a Facebook extension <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s a Google Chrome extension. You need to download it and once it’s installed, just click on the story, and it will be saved and downloaded in the Download option.</p><ol><li><strong>Will people know if I viewed their Facebook story?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, just like you can see who viewed your Facebook story, others can also check the same by clicking on the viewer option available on their story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-reverse-image-retrieval-in-social-media-fb-explained-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Reverse-Image Retrieval in Social Media (FB) Explained for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-essential-tips-for-monitoring-facebook-live-streams-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Essential Tips for Monitoring Facebook Live Streams for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-network-growth-strategy-share-twitch-live-links-on-fb/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Network Growth Strategy  Share Twitch Live Links on FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-high-end-fb-photo-and-film-artist-free-access/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, High-End FB Photo & Film Artist (Free Access)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-direct-sharing-twitch-live-links-for-facebook-friends/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Direct Sharing  Twitch Live Links for Facebook Friends</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-free-and-online-facebook-music-downloaders/"><u>In 2024, Free And Online Facebook Music Downloaders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-360-videos-for-fb-creation-and-sharing-guide/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Mastering 360 Videos for FB  Creation & Sharing Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-facebooks-ultimate-guide-to-full-screen-video/"><u>In 2024, Facebook's Ultimate Guide to Full Screen Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-inside-look-best-practices-for-splitting-audiences-with-fb-live/"><u>[New] In 2024, Inside Look  Best Practices for Splitting Audiences with FB Live</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-pioneering-techniques-for-cross-social-video-sharing/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Pioneering Techniques for Cross-Social Video Sharing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-delete-icloud-account-remove-your-apple-id-permanently-from-iphone-7-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Delete iCloud Account Remove Your Apple ID Permanently From iPhone 7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-premium-commercial-sky-data-haven/"><u>In 2024, Premium Commercial Sky Data Haven</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-unlock-the-full-potential-of-your-pcgaming-with-obs-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unlock the Full Potential of Your PC/Gaming with OBS for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-linux-video-editing-top-10-premiere-alternatives/"><u>New 2024 Approved The Ultimate Guide to Linux Video Editing Top 10 Premiere Alternatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/what-pokemon-evolve-with-a-dawn-stone-for-honor-x7b-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>What Pokémon Evolve with A Dawn Stone For Honor X7b?

Whether it is a blog post, picture, video or even a meme, getting something trending can add a significant amount of followers to a page.</p><p> Companies can identify trending topics by seeing what is making the headlines at major sites, such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/" >Buzzfeed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as it shows the topics that people are talking about at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/increase-followers-trendy-content.JPG"                      alt="Create Trendy Content"                ></p><h3 id="2-Don’t-Ignore-the-Power-of-Email"><a href="#2-Don’t-Ignore-the-Power-of-Email" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Ignore the Power of Email"></a>2. Don’t Ignore the Power of Email</h3><p> If your company already has a significant email list for marketing purposes, <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/the-social-email/" >targeting that email list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to boost Facebook follower counts is a great idea. When you send a newsletter to your mail list, make sure you add a call to action regarding Facebook.</p><p> Encourage them to like your page so they can get the latest updates, discounts and other valuable content! Even if you get a percentage of those on the email list to follower your account, it will be a great help as you attempt to boost your follower count.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/email-increase-facebook-follower.JPG"                      alt="email increse facebook follower"                ></p><h3 id="3-Use-the-Facebook-Follow-Button"><a href="#3-Use-the-Facebook-Follow-Button" class="headerlink" title="3. Use the Facebook Follow Button"></a>3. Use the Facebook Follow Button</h3><p> Companies would be surprised at the amount of users who want to check out their social media pages, but are not sure if they exist. When someone visits your website, there should be a clear button present to indicate you are on that social media platform.</p><p> You can <a class="link"   href="https://www.dummies.com/business/marketing/social-media-marketing/how-to-activate-the-follow-button-on-a-facebook-personal-profile/" >create your own Facebook follow button <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which you can place on various pages on your website. When users click on that button, they will go directly to your Facebook page. If they are already signed into the site, they just have to click the follow button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/follow-button.JPG"                      alt="facebook follow button"                ></p><h3 id="4-Create-Facebook-Videos"><a href="#4-Create-Facebook-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4. Create Facebook Videos"></a>4. Create Facebook Videos</h3><p> Statistics show that videos get a lot more traction and response from users on Facebook. Showcasing interesting video content about your company, products or services is a great way to gain more followers.</p><p> A Facebook video should be short and sweet - getting to the point immediately. Videos could tease products and services, announce discounts, or offer a behind the scenes look at how the company is run.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-video.JPG"                      alt="facebook video"                ></p><h3 id="5-Write-a-Great-Introduction"><a href="#5-Write-a-Great-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="5. Write a Great Introduction"></a>5. Write a Great Introduction</h3><p> Do not ignore the “About” section on your Facebook profile. When you fill in that section with all the relevant information, people will have an easier time seeing your page on search results pages.</p><p> Not only do you show up higher on Facebook searches, but also on Google search engine rankings. Information such as the company name, address, number, mission statement and other details should be included in the about section. The more people know, the better your profile comes across.</p><h3 id="6-Add-Hashtags-to-the-Post"><a href="#6-Add-Hashtags-to-the-Post" class="headerlink" title="6. Add Hashtags to the Post"></a>6. Add Hashtags to the Post</h3><p> Many companies still associate hashtags with Twitter. But they have become a critical part of interacting on Facebook as well. When a person clicks on a hashtag or enters it in the search bar, they can see all relevant posts with that hashtag.</p><p> When you are attempting to create trending content, <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/facebookmedia/blog/using-hashtags-on-facebook" >adding hashtags is a helpful way <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get more people to notice and read your posts. Even people who do not follow your page will be able to see your posts, especially if they begin to trend.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-hashtag.JPG"                      alt="use hashtag increase follower"                ></p><h3 id="7-Try-Facebook-Live"><a href="#7-Try-Facebook-Live" class="headerlink" title="7. Try Facebook Live"></a>7. Try Facebook Live</h3><p> Facebook Live offers a great opportunity for companies to live stream with their viewers, giving them personalized and behind the scenes access into operations.</p><p> When someone is following your page, they get a notification that you are in a live stream. They can even interact with the video with likes or by commenting. Live videos can also help build an audience as other people tune into your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-live.JPG"                      alt="facebook live"                ></p><h3 id="8-Consider-Cooperating-with-Other-Influencers"><a href="#8-Consider-Cooperating-with-Other-Influencers" class="headerlink" title="8. Consider Cooperating with Other Influencers"></a>8. Consider Cooperating with Other Influencers</h3><p> Do not be afraid to engage with your audience. A Facebook account is not just for status updates or company information. It is a place where you can directly connect with your audience.</p><p> Answering questions, providing clever replies and other ways of interaction can help make your brand feel more personal. You can also interact with influencers who have a huge follower count, especially if you already have a positive working relationship with those influencers.</p><h3 id="9-Post-at-the-Right-Time"><a href="#9-Post-at-the-Right-Time" class="headerlink" title="9. Post at the Right Time"></a>9. Post at the Right Time</h3><p> When you post matters just as much as what you post, especially if you want to boost engagement. Studies show that if you post between 1pm and 4pm from Thursday to Sunday, you have a chance of getting around 20 to 30 percent more engagement.</p><p> The study showed that 3pm is best if you want more clicks, while 1pm gets you a lot of shares. Those who want to build up their follower count should focus on shares, which means posting around 1pm from Thursday to Sunday!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-posting-time.JPG"                      alt="posting time"                ></p><h3 id="10-Take-Risks"><a href="#10-Take-Risks" class="headerlink" title="10. Take Risks"></a>10. Take Risks</h3><p> Playing it safe is fine for major companies that already have a lot of brand awareness, loyalty and a huge follower count. Companies that want to make a splash and gain more traction should not be afraid to take risks with posts, replies and videos.</p><p> Taking risks does not mean saying something insensitive, rude or alienating. It is important to toe the line and to know when a bit of edgy humor can be helpful. Companies that can find the right balance will have a lot of success in gaining followers.</p><h2 id="Conslusionc"><a href="#Conslusionc" class="headerlink" title="Conslusionc"></a>Conslusionc</h2><p> The process of how to increase followers on Facebook is relatively simple, especially when it is broken down into steps. But it can be so important for brands to understand how they can boost their follower count and gain greater brand awareness on the social media platform. It will also help you connect with more powerful influencers, which will only boost your brand even more<img src="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" alt="![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)"><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-why-is-my-social-media-not-showing-suggested-youtube-videos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Why Is My Social Media Not Showing Suggested YouTube Videos?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-yearly-recorder-real-time-social-media-events/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Yearly Recorder  Real-Time Social Media Events</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-unearth-these-quirky-overlooked-facebook-pages/"><u>[Updated] Unearth These Quirky, Overlooked Facebook Pages</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/enhancing-fb-video-content-with-streamlined-captioning-tactics-for-2024/"><u>Enhancing FB Video Content with Streamlined Captioning Tactics for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-breaking-down-facebooks-latest-developments/"><u>[New] Breaking Down Facebook's Latest Developments</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-elevate-your-profile-picture-game-with-these-high-end-online-services/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Elevate Your Profile Picture Game with These High-End Online Services</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-facebooks-2023-vision-mastering-the-art-of-short-videos-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Facebook's 2023 Vision  Mastering the Art of Short Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-stop-ff-videos-from-not-rendering-on-android/"><u>2024 Approved  Stop FF Videos From Not Rendering on Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-composition-techniques-for-eye-catching-fb-ad-content/"><u>In 2024, Composition Techniques for Eye-Catching FB Ad Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-youtube-video-distribution-on-fb/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  The Ultimate Guide to YouTube Video Distribution on FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/the-magnificent-art-of-pokemon-go-streaming-on-oneplus-nord-3-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>The Magnificent Art of Pokemon Go Streaming On OnePlus Nord 3 5G?

Being dragged through the media mud inspired the company to return to its cores and to offer a unique social media experience for all of its users once more. At the beginning of 2018, it became possible for the first time to <strong>record video calls on Facebook</strong> from an iPhone or iPad that has an iOS.11 or later version of the operating system installed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-facebook-video-calls.jpg"                      alt="record facebook video calls"                ></p><p>Facebook was also one of the first social media networks that started offering the live video call option back in 2011.

Wondershare’s full-featured software provides a quick and easy way to record all your desktop activities in HD, even <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K video quality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it also features a video editing mode where you can brush up your videos.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>Filmora can record videos via the built-in or an external webcam record system audio and audio from an external source, which means you record videos using professional equipment. You can start a new screen recording session by clicking on the software’s desktop icon and selecting the Quick Capture mode from the software’s welcome window. Before each session, you should choose the area of the screen you want to record, change the video’s frame rate, and choose the video and audio capturing devices. After you’ve adjusted the settings for the screen recording session, you can start a video call on Facebook and then hit the Record button to start capturing the video.</p><p>Pause or stop recording at any moment by clicking on the appropriate buttons in the software’s toolbar or by using the Hotkey F10. Once the session is complete, the video file you’ve created will be opened in Filmora video editing mode. The software’s video editor offers transitions, cutting, and trimming tools, as well as a rich selection of annotations, filters, and effects. Filmora video editor supports nearly all popular input video file formats, but you can only export Facebook video calls as MP4 or MOV files. The software also enables you to capture videos on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Even though the devices that run on iOS 11 operating systems can record Facebook video calls, in theory, this feature has been inactive recently. The feature functions sporadically even on the iOS 13 version of the operating system. The App Store doesn’t offer too many choices for capturing screens on iPhones and iPads.</p><p>When you install the app on your device, you should enable the Mirroring option in the AirPlay app to project the screen of your iPhone to a computer. Then proceed to make a video call on Facebook and hit the record button displayed on the top of the screen you projected from your phone. The Appersoft app offers support for MP4, FLV, or GIF files, and it can capture footage in 1080p and 720p video resolution. You won’t be able to edit your videos with Appersoft, but the App Store offers a lot of great video editing apps at reasonable prices.</p><h2 id="Method-3-Record-Facebook-Video-Call-on-Android-Devices"><a href="#Method-3-Record-Facebook-Video-Call-on-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Record Facebook Video Call on Android Devices"></a>Method 3: Record Facebook Video Call on Android Devices</h2><p>The Google Play Store provides a wide range of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording apps for Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and most of them feature enough screen recording tools to enable you to record a video call on Facebook. <strong>DU Recorder</strong> is one of the best options at your disposal because it is completely free and contains no in-app purchases.</p><p>The app lets you adjust frame rates, capture HD videos, and control the video recording settings from the notifications bar. The phone’s front camera can be used to record yourself speaking during the video call on Facebook, and you can also record external sound with the app. Du Recorder offers an alternative storage option that enables you to store Facebook video call recordings in your chosen location.</p><p>Besides being a powerful tool for capturing a screen of an Android device, this versatile app also offers video editing and live streaming services. The Du Recorder’s screen capturing mode can also produce GIF files, which can produce popular social media content.</p><h2 id="Method-4-Record-Chat-Videos-with-Facebook-Messanger"><a href="#Method-4-Record-Chat-Videos-with-Facebook-Messanger" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Record Chat Videos with Facebook Messanger"></a>Method 4: Record Chat Videos with Facebook Messanger</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-videos-with-fb-messenger.jpg"                      alt="record videos with facebook messenger"                ></p><p>Android users can record all of their video calls from the Facebook Messenger app. You can start recording a video by launching the app and selecting the contact from the People With Messenger list in the Messanger tab. After you’ve selected the contact to whom the video will be sent, you should tap on the Camera button, located near the bottom of the screen, and then place your finger on the ‘Hold send button for video, tap for photo’ button and hold it there while recording the video. The video recording will stop once you lift your finger up and the video will be automatically sent to the contact you selected.</p><p>Using this method, a video captured with Facebook Messenger will not be saved on your Android phone, but you can change this setting and save all your Facebook video calls on your device’s SD card. Tap on your profile picture in the Facebook Messenger app, and find the ‘Photos, Videos, and Emoji’ menu.</p><p>The ‘Download Videos’ option in the ‘Photos, Videos and Emoji’ tab will be set on Wi-Fi Only by default, and you can activate the video download feature simply by tapping on the ON option in the ‘Download Videos’ window. You can disable this option whenever you want if the videos take too much of your phone’s memory by tapping on the OFF button, but the videos you download will play much smoother than the ones stored on the cloud.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Though it is convenient to record the Facebook video calls and chats, we recommend you inform the one who is calling you before recording the video.

Being a versatile social media application, there is one feature that makes it even better: the ability to upload stories. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Facebook stories <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stay for only 24 hours, which is good if you want to upload a quick photo, video or write something that reflects your current status. Other than posting pictures on your profile that stay for everyone to see for as long as you want, stories work a bit differently, which is it lasts only for 24 hours and vanishes automatically.</p><p>Just like you can upload something on your story for others to see, you can also see others’ stories. This brings us to the question if there is a way to view someone’s stories without letting them know that you have checked them out? Well, yes, you can <strong>view Facebook stories anonymously</strong> by following a few tricks. What happens is that when you check someone’s story, they can check who has viewed it. Then, to view the stories, you need to go to the home page and click on any story on the top that you want to see. Since you want to become the anonymous <strong>Facebook story viewer,</strong> let’s find some techniques to do that.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to View Someone’s Facebook Story Anonymously</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook Normally</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Check Who Have Seen My Facebook Story</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs About Viewing Facebook Story</a></li></ul><hr><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

So, what happens is that when the Airplane Mode is enabled, and you check a story, Facebook will fail to register your account as one of the <strong>Facebook story viewers.</strong> This is a pretty easy technique. Here’s how you need to apply this method.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your iOS or Android device’s Facebook account. Once you are there, log in using your credentials, and then you will see the home page and, on the top, will be the stories of different people.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, turn on the airplane mode to go offline, and then open the home page again and click on any story you want to see. The story will begin to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-facebook-story-anonymously-via-offline.jpg"                      alt="View Facebok Story anonymously via offline"                ></p><p>Once you are done, force close the Facebook application so that it doesn’t run in the background when you disable the Airplane Mode. Because if you do that, your name can get registered. So, close the app completely. Please note that when the Airplane mode is on, some stories will not load. To watch them, you need to turn on and off the airplane mode again.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Half-Swipe"><a href="#Method-2-Half-Swipe" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Half Swipe"></a>Method 2: Half Swipe</h3><p>As the name suggests, rather than watching the entire story, you need to stop watching it halfway through. The only apparent disadvantage of this method is you won’t be able to see the whole story. The step that you will have to follow will be similar to watching a story normally. Follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Facebook application and click on any of the stories.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While viewing, put the finger on the story right before the story is about to end.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Quickly swipe right or left and make sure the story doesn’t end. This way, Facebook won’t register you.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Block-Them"><a href="#Method-3-Block-Them" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Block Them"></a>Method 3: Block Them</h3><p>This is another method to stop appearing as one of the viewers. This method will let you view the whole story; however, since it involves blocking the user, they will be removed from your friend list completely. So, try it if only you are fine with removing that person from your friends’ list. Here’s how to follow this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook account and log in, and then <strong>c</strong>lick on the story that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once done, block the person. If you want, you can unblock them after 24 hours.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously"><a href="#Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously"></a>Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously</h3><p>For the last resort, you can deactivate your account and reactivate it after a while so that your name doesn’t appear on the viewer’s list. Even though this is an extreme step to take, but it keeps you anonymous. So, here’s how you can do this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log in to your Facebook account and log in and then click on the story or stories that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the three dots on the top right, then select the Settings and Privacy option, click on the Privacy Shortcuts option.</p><p> <strong>Step 3:</strong> You will see the Delete Your Account option. Please click on that. Two options will be available: deactivate your account and delete your account.

You must learn to get featured on Techcrunch, Forbes, etc. You can also [write a press release to get exposure](https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-write-press-releases-examples-templates/). You may also hire my digital marketing agency for the same.  * **Your Wikipedia is missing** \- In order to create a Wiki; you firstly require the high-quality press.  * **Your identity proof is not up to the mark** \- When your reason for verification request is not very compelling or the ID provided by you is blurry or inappropriate, your request may get rejected.  * **Missing Facebook Native Content** \- Facebook hates a dead page.
