At the beginning of 2018, it became possible for the first time to <strong>record video calls on Facebook</strong> from an iPhone or iPad that has an iOS.11 or later version of the operating system installed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-facebook-video-calls.jpg"                      alt="record facebook video calls"                ></p><p>Facebook was also one of the first social media networks that started offering the live video call option back in 2011.

You can start a new screen recording session by clicking on the software’s desktop icon and selecting the Quick Capture mode from the software’s welcome window. Before each session, you should choose the area of the screen you want to record, change the video’s frame rate, and choose the video and audio capturing devices. After you’ve adjusted the settings for the screen recording session, you can start a video call on Facebook and then hit the Record button to start capturing the video.</p><p>Pause or stop recording at any moment by clicking on the appropriate buttons in the software’s toolbar or by using the Hotkey F10. Once the session is complete, the video file you’ve created will be opened in Filmora video editing mode. The software’s video editor offers transitions, cutting, and trimming tools, as well as a rich selection of annotations, filters, and effects. Filmora video editor supports nearly all popular input video file formats, but you can only export Facebook video calls as MP4 or MOV files.

Even though the devices that run on iOS 11 operating systems can record Facebook video calls, in theory, this feature has been inactive recently. The feature functions sporadically even on the iOS 13 version of the operating system. The App Store doesn’t offer too many choices for capturing screens on iPhones and iPads.</p><p>When you install the app on your device, you should enable the Mirroring option in the AirPlay app to project the screen of your iPhone to a computer. Then proceed to make a video call on Facebook and hit the record button displayed on the top of the screen you projected from your phone. The Appersoft app offers support for MP4, FLV, or GIF files, and it can capture footage in 1080p and 720p video resolution. You won’t be able to edit your videos with Appersoft, but the App Store offers a lot of great video editing apps at reasonable prices.</p><h2 id="Method-3-Record-Facebook-Video-Call-on-Android-Devices"><a href="#Method-3-Record-Facebook-Video-Call-on-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Record Facebook Video Call on Android Devices"></a>Method 3: Record Facebook Video Call on Android Devices</h2><p>The Google Play Store provides a wide range of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording apps for Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and most of them feature enough screen recording tools to enable you to record a video call on Facebook. <strong>DU Recorder</strong> is one of the best options at your disposal because it is completely free and contains no in-app purchases.</p><p>The app lets you adjust frame rates, capture HD videos, and control the video recording settings from the notifications bar. The phone’s front camera can be used to record yourself speaking during the video call on Facebook, and you can also record external sound with the app. Du Recorder offers an alternative storage option that enables you to store Facebook video call recordings in your chosen location.</p><p>Besides being a powerful tool for capturing a screen of an Android device, this versatile app also offers video editing and live streaming services. The Du Recorder’s screen capturing mode can also produce GIF files, which can produce popular social media content.</p><h2 id="Method-4-Record-Chat-Videos-with-Facebook-Messanger"><a href="#Method-4-Record-Chat-Videos-with-Facebook-Messanger" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Record Chat Videos with Facebook Messanger"></a>Method 4: Record Chat Videos with Facebook Messanger</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-videos-with-fb-messenger.jpg"                      alt="record videos with facebook messenger"                ></p><p>Android users can record all of their video calls from the Facebook Messenger app. You can start recording a video by launching the app and selecting the contact from the People With Messenger list in the Messanger tab. After you’ve selected the contact to whom the video will be sent, you should tap on the Camera button, located near the bottom of the screen, and then place your finger on the ‘Hold send button for video, tap for photo’ button and hold it there while recording the video. The video recording will stop once you lift your finger up and the video will be automatically sent to the contact you selected.</p><p>Using this method, a video captured with Facebook Messenger will not be saved on your Android phone, but you can change this setting and save all your Facebook video calls on your device’s SD card. Tap on your profile picture in the Facebook Messenger app, and find the ‘Photos, Videos, and Emoji’ menu.</p><p>The ‘Download Videos’ option in the ‘Photos, Videos and Emoji’ tab will be set on Wi-Fi Only by default, and you can activate the video download feature simply by tapping on the ON option in the ‘Download Videos’ window. You can disable this option whenever you want if the videos take too much of your phone’s memory by tapping on the OFF button, but the videos you download will play much smoother than the ones stored on the cloud.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Though it is convenient to record the Facebook video calls and chats, we recommend you inform the one who is calling you before recording the video.

Wondering how to make your videos better for your News Feed? Worry not, my friend! We have all the answers!</p><p>Just as we are mindful of the orientation of our pictures, similarly, we should focus on the orientation of our videos as well.</p><p>If you want to take a close-up of someone, you should use the portrait orientation; however, landscape orientation should be your go-to if you want a zoomed-out look. However, in the age of social media, you need to be mindful of where you will post the content.</p><p>This is because different social media platforms support different orientations, as shown in the image below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-1.jpg"                      alt="Different Video Aspect Ratios on Mobile Devices"                ></p><p>So, for your Facebook videos, the ideal aspect ratio is 2:3. However, let’s take a closer look and see what works best for you; horizontal video or vertical Facebook video?</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="#step3">Bonus Tip! How to Make Horizontal or Vertical Video Using Wondershare Filmora.</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Choose-Vertical-Video-or-Horizontal-Video-for-Facebook"><a href="#Part-1-Choose-Vertical-Video-or-Horizontal-Video-for-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?"></a>Part 1. Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</h2><p>Initially, Facebook had a platform that supported horizontal videos. Facebook displayed the vertical videos in squares, which led to a cropped video display. Users had to click on the video in order to watch it.</p><p>Snapchat pioneered the concept of vertical videos. Eventually, the rest of the social media apps followed suit, especially after introducing the Story feature.</p><p>Back in 2015, after analyzing the data and seeing that more people engage with vertical videos, Facebook updated the app such that vertical videos fit well in the News Feed. This not only worked out well for the users but also advertisers and publishers.</p><p>However, you may be wondering why Facebook didn’t switch completely to vertical videos like Snapchat. Well, this is because horizontal videos have their benefits as well. So, let’s look at different situations in which vertical or horizontal videos come in handy.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason why horizontal videos are in for the running is because our eyes have a horizontal alignment. So naturally, the horizontal view is more appealing for us.</p><p>The horizontal frame works best if you record things of daily life, such as making a video of multiple people or videos with different dynamics and motion.</p><p>Furthermore, you should go for horizontal videos if you plan on watching them on TVs or monitors as they have a horizontal orientation.</p><p>So, if you want to share a video of your group of friends on Facebook, make a horizontal video. Since Facebook did not completely shift to vertical videos, horizontal videos still work without ruining the outlook of your Feed.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason that vertical videos have become so popular is because of the shape of our smartphones. Since our smartphones have a vertical orientation, thus vertical videos are more feasible. This is because users hold their phones upright 94% of the time.</p><p>So, in order to engage the maximum audience, it is best to upload a vertical Facebook video. Since Facebook supports vertical videos, it becomes super easy to attract users’ attention.</p><p>Moreover, an analysis of the stats shows that vertical videos give you more value for your money than horizontal videos. In addition to this, a study also found that the completion rates of vertical videos were 4% higher than horizontal videos.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos"></a>Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</h2><p>When talking about the orientation of a video, an important concept that one must know is the Size Aspect Ratio.</p><p>In simple words, the size aspect ratio describes an image or video’s shape. It is written as a formula of width to height. For example, a square has a 1:1 size aspect ratio.</p><p>So, while making a Facebook video or during the post-production editing phase, you can adjust the size aspect ratio as per your requirement.</p><p>If you want to upload a vertical video on Facebook, then 9:16 is the perfect aspect ratio. Due to the upright positions of our phones, the 9:16 ratio works ideally for all the users.</p><p>However, if you want to upload a horizontal video on Facebook, you can use a 16:9 or a 1:1 aspect ratio.</p><p>Other aspect ratios that Facebook supports are given below in the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-2.jpg"                      alt="Supported Aspect Ratios for Facebook Ads"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

When you pin a song, it will be added to your profile. You can pin one song at a time, though. To do that, follow the steps below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook page and log in using your Facebook credentials. Please remember that this feature is only available for smartphones and iPad.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to your profile page and locate the Music tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile-music-option.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Profile Music Option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, click on the Music option. Each song will have three dots; click on that, and then you will see the option Pin to Profile. Click on that, and the song will be pinned to your profile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pin-music-on-facebook-profile.jpg"                      alt="Pin music on Facebook Profile"                ></p><p>To check whether the song is pinned to your profile or not, visit your Facebook profile, and you will see it right below your profile picture.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Play-and-Listen-Songs-You-Have-Added-to-Facebook-Profile"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Play-and-Listen-Songs-You-Have-Added-to-Facebook-Profile" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Play and Listen Songs You Have Added to Facebook Profile?"></a>Part 3: How to Play and Listen Songs You Have Added to Facebook Profile?</h2><p>By adding fresh songs to your profile, you will make your profile look and sound better. And it’s pretty apparent that after adding a song to your profile picture, you will like to hear it out as well. So, here’s how you can listen to the added song.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your Facebook profile on your smartphone or tab and go to your profile page.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once again, go to the Music option and click on that.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You will see all songs that you have added to your profile. Click on any of the songs to listen to it. Moreover, you can click on any song to listen to it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile-music-history-list.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Profile Music History"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Remove-Unwanted-Music-from-Facebook-Profile"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Remove-Unwanted-Music-from-Facebook-Profile" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Remove Unwanted Music from Facebook Profile?"></a>Part 4: How to Remove Unwanted Music from Facebook Profile?</h2><p>Just like you can add songs to your profile, you can easily remove them as well. For example, you may be over the song and want to replace it with a new one. Here’s the step-by-step guide to doing that:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook profile page and not the feed page. On your profile, scroll down a bit and click on the Music icon.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the three horizontal dots right beside the song, and you will see some options.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> From the options, you need to click on the deleted song from the profile option. By doing this, the song will be permanently removed from your profile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-music-track-from-facebook-profile.jpg"                      alt="delete Facebook Profile Music"                ></p><p>You can remove one song or multiple of them.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Where-Can-I-Find-the-Music-Feature-on-Facebook-Profile"><a href="#Part-5-Where-Can-I-Find-the-Music-Feature-on-Facebook-Profile" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Where Can I Find the Music Feature on Facebook Profile?"></a>Part 5: Where Can I Find the Music Feature on Facebook Profile?</h2><p>If you are someone who likes to express yourself through music, then Facebook can let you do that efficiently. This new feature rolled out a few years back. To find the add Music feature on your profile, you need to follow the following steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, launch your Facebook app and log in using your credentials. You will be taken to the feed page first. Once you are there, click on your profile to go to your profile page.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you are there on your profile, you need to scroll down a little, and you will see the Music tab.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click on the Music tab. Since it’s your first time using the Music feature, the Music page will be blank.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click on the + icon that you see on the top right, and the music search window will appear. You can search for the songs you like to add to your profile here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile-music-feature.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Profile Music feature"                ></p><p>And that’s how the Music feature works on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Music makes this world better, and we agree with that. Now that Facebook allows you to add a song to your profile, feel free to express yourself better because you never know who you might inspire just by adding a relatable song to your profile, right. Moreover, you can choose a song according to your mood and add it to your profile to reflect on your current feeling.

Nowadays any iOS user can take stunning 360 degree photos on their iPhone and iPad and upload them directly on Facebook. If you are an iPhone user who is wondering how to create 360 degree photos and videos should keep reading this article where we are going to explain you everything about capturing 360 degrees pictures and videos.</p><h2 id="How-to-take-360-videos-from-your-iPad-and-iPhone-without-any-additional-hardware-for-FB"><a href="#How-to-take-360-videos-from-your-iPad-and-iPhone-without-any-additional-hardware-for-FB" class="headerlink" title="How to take 360 videos from your iPad and iPhone without any additional hardware for FB"></a>How to take 360 videos from your iPad and iPhone without any additional hardware for FB</h2><p> The introduction of a variety of VR headsets along with a range of cameras with 360 degree video shooting ability is a clear indicator of the fact that the future lies with Virtual Reality. However not all tech enthusiasts would be able to afford these super expensive cameras. This might lead one to believe that 360 degree videos aren’t for people like you and me. However, this is not the fact. In the last few years Apple has enhanced the iPhone cameras to a great extent and these days you can use your iPhone to create casual 360 degree videos. Keep reading to find out the easiest way to capture 360 degree videos on your iPad and iPhone with the help of Splash 360. The best part is that you can do it without spending on any additional hardware.</p><h4 id="Splash"><a href="#Splash" class="headerlink" title="Splash"></a>Splash</h4><p> This is an all new application for iPhone which would help you come up with superb 360 degree photos and videos. It is incredible that Splash has created an application which would allow the users to capture up to 10 videos of 2 seconds duration and then stitch them together to create a new video. All this can be done on your smartphone. It goes without saying that the best part of this application is that you can download it for free. With the help of Splash you will be able to directly upload all your photos and videos on Facebook or share them with your friends through a link. The Splash app also comes with full support for Google Cardboard headsets which would let you fully concentrate in the 360 degree environment.</p><h4 id="Capturing-with-Splash-on-iPhone"><a href="#Capturing-with-Splash-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Capturing with Splash on iPhone"></a>Capturing with Splash on iPhone</h4><p> Shooting 360 degree videos on Splash is almost child play and it can be mastered even by novices. Let’s take a step by step look at how to shoot 360 degree videos with Splash.</p><ul><li>Open the Splash app and you will be able to see a green button with a camera icon in the home page. Tapping this green button would allow the application to capture videos from the camera of your iPhone.</li><li>In the video interface of the Splash app you will be able to capture a 360 degree video just like capturing a panorama. All you need to do is point the phone at the position where you want to start and the press the shutter button and hold it for shooting the video. Now you can change the position of your camera in whichever way you want and keep recording till you have finished shooting the sphere.</li><li>When you have recorded all the angles by rotating the camera of your iPhone you need to hit the green checkmark.</li><li>In case you are not looking forward to capturing the entire sphere you can always choose to stop shooting midway.</li><li>Lastly you need to save your work before you hit the share button. The sharing option list is right there on the screen- all you have to do is just single tap on it and post your creation wherever you want.</li></ul><p> Tips: Like any other 360 degree recording application which is dependent on the movement of the phone for capturing an entire sphere, the video quality of Splash is going to depend on the stability of the phone while shooting. Therefore make sure not to move much while shooting. No matter how hard you try to keep your hands steady there is surely going to be a few jerks. This is precisely why you need to use a small tripod where you can position the phone and rotate it. Using a tripod is the safest bet since it not only ensures better stability but also gives you enhanced video quality.</p><h2 id="Taking-360-degree-videos-on-iPhone-and-iPad-with-Attached-Lens"><a href="#Taking-360-degree-videos-on-iPhone-and-iPad-with-Attached-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Taking 360 degree videos on iPhone and iPad with Attached Lens"></a>Taking 360 degree videos on iPhone and iPad with Attached Lens</h2><p> If you want to create a stunning 360 degree video with your iOS mobile device then you need to make use of an all new 3K 360 degree camera called Insta360 Nano. Insta360 Nano which is available for less than $200 on Amazon is one of the cheapest devices for capturing real cool 360 degree videos. It can also be used as a standalone 360 degree cam which just needs to be connected with your iPhone for viewing your captures, tweaking the settings and for getting a live preview.</p><h4 id="Capturing-with-Insta360-on-iPhone"><a href="#Capturing-with-Insta360-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Capturing with Insta360 on iPhone"></a>Capturing with Insta360 on iPhone</h4><ul><li>To capture a video&#x2F;photo just connect the Insta360 Nano to your iPhone via lightning.</li><li>Now launch the app and hit the shutter button to shoot.

Avoid bombarding your followers with too many posts.</p><ul><li><strong>Know the best times to publish your posts</strong></li></ul><p>If you run a Facebook business page, understand when your audiences are likely to be free. Scheduling posts for early morning publication and evening after work can attract more views and reads.</p><ul><li><strong>Maintain relevance in your posts</strong></li></ul><p>Your Facebook friends and followers are there because they expect certain content from you. As you schedule a post, ensure its in-line with what you advocate for or is related to your business. As in the case of KFC above, all posts are either introducing a new product or promoting an existing product.</p><ul><li><strong>Take advantage of events related to your Facebook post to as you schedule</strong></li></ul><p>Do you want to triple your audience with every Facebook post? There will always be big event related to your page. Create and optimize a post related to the event and schedule it to be published immediately after or during the event.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Even though scheduling Facebook posts helps save time, many people are missing the point and just setting any date and time. They don’t factor their intended results or mind using analytics to know the impact of their posts.</p><p>Now that how to schedule a post on Facebook is right at your fingertips, It’s critically important to ask yourself the following questions before you set the date and time:</p><ol><li>Why schedule this post on this date and time?</li><li>What do I expect to achieve?</li><li>Will my post find the right audience during their free time?</li></ol><p>As you answer these questions, kindly share with us how this article helped you or leave a comment on our social media platforms.</p><p><a

But, they are unaware of the significance of Facebook SEO and what potential it has for their brand enhancement. If the SEO for your Facebook page is done right, your brand’s Google rankings would move a notch higher. This in turn will <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >attract more influencers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> organically to find you. If you are unsure about the entire process of implementing SEO for Facebook, then here is a quick peek through.</p><p> In this article, we are going to introduce you the significant aspects and ways for enhancing the Facebook SEO strategy for your brand.</p><h2 id="How-to-optimize-Facebook-SEO"><a href="#How-to-optimize-Facebook-SEO" class="headerlink" title="How to optimize Facebook SEO"></a>How to optimize Facebook SEO</h2><h3 id="1-Optimize-Facebook-Content"><a href="#1-Optimize-Facebook-Content" class="headerlink" title="1. Optimize Facebook Content"></a>1. Optimize Facebook Content</h3><p> Speaking of SEO for Facebook page, though, it might not have a direct impact on social media content and popup results for your keyword search on Google. You need to mention the social media platform name in Google search to get the results. Your content will be easily discoverable by users when you <a class="link"   href="https://www.wordstream.com/articles/keyword-research-for-social-media-guide" >optimize social media content using keywords <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Links and public posts using those keywords will show up on the search results.</p><p> People click and engage with your content if it’s relevant to them and included in the keywords, and spend more time on your site.</p><h3 id="2-Optimize-Page-URL"><a href="#2-Optimize-Page-URL" class="headerlink" title="2. Optimize Page URL"></a>2. Optimize Page URL</h3><p> For Facebook SEO, you need to have a <a class="link"   href="https://www.weebly.com/seo/url" >custom URL same as your brand name <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It eventually promotes brand recognition and makes users remember your brand. Unless you create a custom URL for your Facebook page, Facebook might auto-generate a long and tough to memorize URL. Using ‘Page Info’ under your Facebook page’s ‘About’ section, access the ‘Create Page @username’ and create the username. Set the brand name in place of username and you are good to go.</p><h3 id="3-Optimize-company-profile"><a href="#3-Optimize-company-profile" class="headerlink" title="3. Optimize company profile"></a>3. Optimize company profile</h3><p> While doing SEO for Facebook page, not every brand optimizes their company profile online. But, it is crucial to optimize and encourage growth of the Facebook fan page for their brands. When you add phone numbers and address on your business page, Google gives more credibility to your page. As a result, your brand’s overall SEO will be enhanced.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile.JPG"                      alt="facebook profile"                ></p><h3 id="4-Optimize-Facebook-Notes"><a href="#4-Optimize-Facebook-Notes" class="headerlink" title="4. Optimize Facebook Notes"></a>4. Optimize Facebook Notes</h3><p> Facebook Notes are utilized to create engagement and inform your fans about important business related news, current crisis or upcoming events. These Notes get indexed post search by Google for business profile only. Through them, you can add keyword rich content and improve the fan page ranks in Google and Bing. Photos as well as the title and Note contain keywords within the caption. After adding captions to your Notes, if users comment in it, then the chances to rank higher increases. If the comments too have keywords as well, the Notes gains more value, attracting engagement and tags.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/note-facebook.JPG"                      alt="Optimize Facebook Notes"                ></p><h3 id="5-Add-Backlink-to-your-fan-page"><a href="#5-Add-Backlink-to-your-fan-page" class="headerlink" title="5. Add Backlink to your fan page"></a>5. Add Backlink to your fan page</h3><p> Facebook SEO requires inbound links to your page, in order to improvise the authoritativeness of your page as per Google for high ranking. Always <a class="link"   href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/external-facebook-fan-30204.html" >include a link to your fan page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from digital channels like blog, website, Twitter profile to your Facebook page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-backlink-facebook.JPG"                      alt="Add Backlink to your fan page"                ></p><h3 id="6-Post-Fresh-Content"><a href="#6-Post-Fresh-Content" class="headerlink" title="6. Post Fresh Content"></a>6. Post Fresh Content</h3><p> Fresh, keyword optimized, quality content is important for social media as well as website pages for any brand. It applies to Facebook equally. Unique content helps your brand rank better, but at times you run out of content ideas. Using influencer marketing, you can add fresh content with a new tone to your content marketing drives. Guest posts, product review, and campaigns on social media takeover can help your business to a great extent. Influencers propel their followers for creating unique content for your business. Through hashtags, they might ask their followers to tag them and your brand as well in social media campaigns or share their experiences.</p><h3 id="7-Make-Business-time-Accurate"><a href="#7-Make-Business-time-Accurate" class="headerlink" title="7. Make Business time Accurate"></a>7. Make Business time Accurate</h3><p> Mentioning the business times on your Facebook page is important. In case it changes, you need to immediately update it. Moreover, new location page additions along with correct operational hours and days should be mentioned too. Facebook doesn’t have the feature to allow you customizing hours for special events or holidays, but you can use Facebook posts and advertising to meet that need.</p><h3 id="8-Optimize-featured-Image"><a href="#8-Optimize-featured-Image" class="headerlink" title="8. Optimize featured Image"></a>8. Optimize featured Image</h3><p> To do justice with SEO on your Facebook page, you need to customize your page by adding an avatar&#x2F;profile feature and utilizing the featured image section at its best. Along with photo, you can also add a video or a slideshow in the featured image&#x2F;banner section. Testimonials, team credits can be promoted in this section. Facebook emphasizes that cover photos shouldn’t be misleading, deceptive, or infringe any copyright.</p><h3 id="9-Manage-Customer-Reviews"><a href="#9-Manage-Customer-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="9. Manage Customer Reviews"></a>9. Manage Customer Reviews</h3><p> Customer interaction and engagement is vital for social media platforms and Facebook allows a great deal in this aspect. There needs to be a proper strategy for <a class="link"   href="https://www.business.qld.gov.au/running-business/consumer-laws/customer-service/managing-customer-reviews/tips" >management of comments and reviews, ads and posts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Always make sure to respond to reviews, even if they are not what you have expected. It builds trust for your brand. You have the control over enabling or disabling customer reviews.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/manage-facebook-comment.JPG"                      alt="Manage Customer Reviews"                ></p><h3 id="10-Include-a-Call-to-Action"><a href="#10-Include-a-Call-to-Action" class="headerlink" title="10. Include a Call-to-Action"></a>10. Include a Call-to-Action</h3><p> Facebook SEO doesn’t typically bring results with regular content sharing. Having a Call-to-Action within your shared links on blogs and product pages on Facebook has more advantages. Click the link, comments, share the post are forms of call to actions here. A compelling CTA actually does the right thing for your post. Without a Call-to-Action, Facebook SEO concept is highly incomplete and hence it is the last and essential tip for you to optimize the SEO of your Facebook.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-call-to-action.JPG"                      alt="Include a Call-to-Action"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> From the above article, we are confident that you have got the goodies you wanted to take home and implement with your Facebook brand page. With such amazing features spread across social media, it’s obvious that gathering high ranks over search engine results won’t be a problem for your brand. Make sure to adhere to the specific guidelines under each section, while implementing SEO strategies on your Facebook brand page. It will improve your overall ranking and visibility over the search results.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload

Nowadays any iOS user can take stunning 360 degree photos on their iPhone and iPad and upload them directly on Facebook. If you are an iPhone user who is wondering how to create 360 degree photos and videos should keep reading this article where we are going to explain you everything about capturing 360 degrees pictures and videos.</p><h2 id="How-to-take-360-videos-from-your-iPad-and-iPhone-without-any-additional-hardware-for-FB"><a href="#How-to-take-360-videos-from-your-iPad-and-iPhone-without-any-additional-hardware-for-FB" class="headerlink" title="How to take 360 videos from your iPad and iPhone without any additional hardware for FB"></a>How to take 360 videos from your iPad and iPhone without any additional hardware for FB</h2><p> The introduction of a variety of VR headsets along with a range of cameras with 360 degree video shooting ability is a clear indicator of the fact that the future lies with Virtual Reality. However not all tech enthusiasts would be able to afford these super expensive cameras. This might lead one to believe that 360 degree videos aren’t for people like you and me. However, this is not the fact. In the last few years Apple has enhanced the iPhone cameras to a great extent and these days you can use your iPhone to create casual 360 degree videos. Keep reading to find out the easiest way to capture 360 degree videos on your iPad and iPhone with the help of Splash 360. The best part is that you can do it without spending on any additional hardware.</p><h4 id="Splash"><a href="#Splash" class="headerlink" title="Splash"></a>Splash</h4><p> This is an all new application for iPhone which would help you come up with superb 360 degree photos and videos. It is incredible that Splash has created an application which would allow the users to capture up to 10 videos of 2 seconds duration and then stitch them together to create a new video. All this can be done on your smartphone. It goes without saying that the best part of this application is that you can download it for free. With the help of Splash you will be able to directly upload all your photos and videos on Facebook or share them with your friends through a link. The Splash app also comes with full support for Google Cardboard headsets which would let you fully concentrate in the 360 degree environment.</p><h4 id="Capturing-with-Splash-on-iPhone"><a href="#Capturing-with-Splash-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Capturing with Splash on iPhone"></a>Capturing with Splash on iPhone</h4><p> Shooting 360 degree videos on Splash is almost child play and it can be mastered even by novices. Let’s take a step by step look at how to shoot 360 degree videos with Splash.</p><ul><li>Open the Splash app and you will be able to see a green button with a camera icon in the home page. Tapping this green button would allow the application to capture videos from the camera of your iPhone.</li><li>In the video interface of the Splash app you will be able to capture a 360 degree video just like capturing a panorama. All you need to do is point the phone at the position where you want to start and the press the shutter button and hold it for shooting the video. Now you can change the position of your camera in whichever way you want and keep recording till you have finished shooting the sphere.</li><li>When you have recorded all the angles by rotating the camera of your iPhone you need to hit the green checkmark.</li><li>In case you are not looking forward to capturing the entire sphere you can always choose to stop shooting midway.</li><li>Lastly you need to save your work before you hit the share button. The sharing option list is right there on the screen- all you have to do is just single tap on it and post your creation wherever you want.</li></ul><p> Tips: Like any other 360 degree recording application which is dependent on the movement of the phone for capturing an entire sphere, the video quality of Splash is going to depend on the stability of the phone while shooting. Therefore make sure not to move much while shooting. No matter how hard you try to keep your hands steady there is surely going to be a few jerks. This is precisely why you need to use a small tripod where you can position the phone and rotate it. Using a tripod is the safest bet since it not only ensures better stability but also gives you enhanced video quality.</p><h2 id="Taking-360-degree-videos-on-iPhone-and-iPad-with-Attached-Lens"><a href="#Taking-360-degree-videos-on-iPhone-and-iPad-with-Attached-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Taking 360 degree videos on iPhone and iPad with Attached Lens"></a>Taking 360 degree videos on iPhone and iPad with Attached Lens</h2><p> If you want to create a stunning 360 degree video with your iOS mobile device then you need to make use of an all new 3K 360 degree camera called Insta360 Nano. Insta360 Nano which is available for less than $200 on Amazon is one of the cheapest devices for capturing real cool 360 degree videos. It can also be used as a standalone 360 degree cam which just needs to be connected with your iPhone for viewing your captures, tweaking the settings and for getting a live preview.</p><h4 id="Capturing-with-Insta360-on-iPhone"><a href="#Capturing-with-Insta360-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Capturing with Insta360 on iPhone"></a>Capturing with Insta360 on iPhone</h4><ul><li>To capture a video&#x2F;photo just connect the Insta360 Nano to your iPhone via lightning.</li><li>Now launch the app and hit the shutter button to shoot.

Being a versatile social media application, there is one feature that makes it even better: the ability to upload stories. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Facebook stories <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stay for only 24 hours, which is good if you want to upload a quick photo, video or write something that reflects your current status. Other than posting pictures on your profile that stay for everyone to see for as long as you want, stories work a bit differently, which is it lasts only for 24 hours and vanishes automatically.</p><p>Just like you can upload something on your story for others to see, you can also see others’ stories. This brings us to the question if there is a way to view someone’s stories without letting them know that you have checked them out? Well, yes, you can <strong>view Facebook stories anonymously</strong> by following a few tricks. What happens is that when you check someone’s story, they can check who has viewed it. Then, to view the stories, you need to go to the home page and click on any story on the top that you want to see. Since you want to become the anonymous <strong>Facebook story viewer,</strong> let’s find some techniques to do that.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to View Someone’s Facebook Story Anonymously</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook Normally</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Check Who Have Seen My Facebook Story</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs About Viewing Facebook Story</a></li></ul><hr><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

[4 Ways]"></a>Part 1: How to View Someone’s Facebook Story Anonymously? [4 Ways]</h2><h3 id="Method-1-Turn-on-the-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Method-1-Turn-on-the-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Turn on the Airplane Mode"></a>Method 1: Turn on the Airplane Mode</h3><p>When you turn on the airplane mode of your device, your phone will no longer be connected to the internet. So, what happens is that when the Airplane Mode is enabled, and you check a story, Facebook will fail to register your account as one of the <strong>Facebook story viewers.</strong> This is a pretty easy technique. Here’s how you need to apply this method.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your iOS or Android device’s Facebook account. Once you are there, log in using your credentials, and then you will see the home page and, on the top, will be the stories of different people.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, turn on the airplane mode to go offline, and then open the home page again and click on any story you want to see. The story will begin to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-facebook-story-anonymously-via-offline.jpg"                      alt="View Facebok Story anonymously via offline"                ></p><p>Once you are done, force close the Facebook application so that it doesn’t run in the background when you disable the Airplane Mode. Because if you do that, your name can get registered. So, close the app completely. Please note that when the Airplane mode is on, some stories will not load. To watch them, you need to turn on and off the airplane mode again.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Half-Swipe"><a href="#Method-2-Half-Swipe" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Half Swipe"></a>Method 2: Half Swipe</h3><p>As the name suggests, rather than watching the entire story, you need to stop watching it halfway through. The only apparent disadvantage of this method is you won’t be able to see the whole story. The step that you will have to follow will be similar to watching a story normally. Follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Facebook application and click on any of the stories.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While viewing, put the finger on the story right before the story is about to end.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Quickly swipe right or left and make sure the story doesn’t end. This way, Facebook won’t register you.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Block-Them"><a href="#Method-3-Block-Them" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Block Them"></a>Method 3: Block Them</h3><p>This is another method to stop appearing as one of the viewers. This method will let you view the whole story; however, since it involves blocking the user, they will be removed from your friend list completely. So, try it if only you are fine with removing that person from your friends’ list. Here’s how to follow this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook account and log in, and then <strong>c</strong>lick on the story that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once done, block the person. If you want, you can unblock them after 24 hours.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously"><a href="#Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously"></a>Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously</h3><p>For the last resort, you can deactivate your account and reactivate it after a while so that your name doesn’t appear on the viewer’s list. Even though this is an extreme step to take, but it keeps you anonymous. So, here’s how you can do this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log in to your Facebook account and log in and then click on the story or stories that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the three dots on the top right, then select the Settings and Privacy option, click on the Privacy Shortcuts option.</p><p> <strong>Step 3:</strong> You will see the Delete Your Account option. Please click on that. Two options will be available: deactivate your account and delete your account. You need to click on the deactivate option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deactivate-facebook-account.jpg"                      alt="deactivate FB account to View Facebok Story anonymously"                ></p><p>Once 24 hours is over, you can log in to reactive your account.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Do-I-See-Someone’s-Story-on-Facebook"><a href="#Part-2-How-Do-I-See-Someone’s-Story-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook?"></a>Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook?</h2><p>There are three easy ways to see someone’s story on Facebook.

This is known as <strong>Facebook story viewers.</strong> This option will be available on your story. Here’s how to check Facebook story viewers.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your Facebook account on a browser or launch the mobile app, whichever works for you. And then click on the Your Story option.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, click on the viewers’ option that you see towards the bottom left.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-who-viewed-facebook-story.jpg"                      alt="View who have seen my Facebok Story"                ></p><p>Now, you can see the list of people’s names who have seen your story.

If your account is public, you will also have the other viewer option, which will show you the number of unknown people who viewed your story. But unfortunately, it doesn’t show you who they are.</p><ol><li><strong>Can I see how many times someone views my Facebook story?</strong></li></ol><p>Currently, Facebook doesn’t have the feature to show how many times someone has viewed your Facebook story. The only thing you can check is who viewed the story.</p><ol><li><strong>What Does “Other Viewers” Mean on Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>Other viewers option appears only on the public accounts. So, when you upload a story on your public profile, it becomes visible for everyone to see. But you can change it by limiting the viewer to friends only. But if there is an “other viewer” option available, it means that someone other than the people in your friend list has seen your story too.</p><ol><li><strong>How to tell if someone has seen my Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>To know whether someone has seen your Facebook story or not, simply click on your story and tap on the viewer’s option. You will have a list of people who checked your story.</p><ol><li><strong>How can I save someone’s Facebook Story after viewing it?</strong></li></ol><p>If you want to save someone’s Facebook story, you can get the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Story Saver for a Facebook extension <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s a Google Chrome extension. You need to download it and once it’s installed, just click on the story, and it will be saved and downloaded in the Download option.</p><ol><li><strong>Will people know if I viewed their Facebook story?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, just like you can see who viewed your Facebook story, others can also check the same by clicking on the viewer option available on their story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-essential-fb-video-loader-apps-ranked-5-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Essential FB Video Loader Apps Ranked #5 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-enhance-youtube-creations-with-soundtrack-perfection-guide/"><u>2024 Approved  Enhance YouTube Creations with Soundtrack Perfection Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-e-identity-revamp-personal-cartoon-character-blueprint-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] E-Identity Revamp  Personal Cartoon Character Blueprint for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-new-era-facebooks-quintessential-features-showcased/"><u>[Updated] New Era  Facebook's Quintessential Features Showcased</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/tracing-back-on-facebook-a-laptop-and-mobile-recipe-for-2024/"><u>Tracing Back on Facebook  A Laptop & Mobile Recipe for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/stop-chrome-from-skipping-playback-of-facebook-videos-for-2024/"><u>Stop Chrome From Skipping Playback of Facebook Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/how-to-capture-and-share-vlogs-effectively-fb-via-obs/"><u>How to Capture & Share Vlogs Effectively (FB via OBS)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-enhance-vfx-quality-best-tiktok-watermark-removers-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Enhance VFX Quality  Best TikTok Watermark Removers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/calls-on-vivo-x100-pro-go-straight-to-voicemail-12-fixes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Calls on Vivo X100 Pro Go Straight to Voicemail? 12 Fixes | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-sim-pin-code-on-your-infinix-note-30-pro-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Change Your SIM PIN Code on Your Infinix Note 30 Pro Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/unlocking-apple-iphone-14-plus-passcode-without-a-computer-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Unlocking Apple iPhone 14 Plus Passcode without a Computer | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/6-empowering-metaverse-instances-explained-for-2024/"><u>6 Empowering Metaverse Instances Explained for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/how-to-come-up-with-the-best-pokemon-team-on-realme-11x-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Come up With the Best Pokemon Team On Realme 11X 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-image-illumination-mastering-grading-art/"><u>In 2024, Image Illumination  Mastering Grading Art</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-create-hilarious-memes-with-these-10-awesome-apps-2023-edition/"><u>New In 2024, Create Hilarious Memes with These 10 Awesome Apps (2023 Edition)</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>
