While catering to billions of users, Facebook has developed as a global social platform providing exceptional services to its customers. Facebook has developed into a very diverse platform from a simple social connectivity tool, allowing individuals and businesses to make a significant social presence.</p><p>From designing videos to making advertisements for impressive branding across Facebook, there is a lot to be done across Facebook. If someone wishes to share a certain video across Facebook, it is quite simple and easy to carry out. This article particularly explains the procedure to <strong>share video on Facebook.</strong> There are multiple techniques to make this possible, which would be the highlighting point within the article.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">4 Ways | Share Videos on Facebook</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">Share Videos to Facebook Story</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="#step3">Share Videos to Facebook Messenger</a></p><p>Part 4: <a href="#step4">Share Videos to Facebook Live</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-4-Ways-Share-Videos-on-Facebook"><a href="#Part-1-4-Ways-Share-Videos-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: 4 Ways | Share Videos on Facebook"></a>Part 1: 4 Ways | Share Videos on Facebook</h2><p>The first and foremost discussion comes onto the ways that can be effectively consumed to <strong>share video on Facebook.</strong> Long before elements such as Facebook Stories and Facebook Messenger were introduced, the only source to <strong>share video on Facebook</strong> was across the profile. This part would focus on the four unique and different ways that can be inherited to <strong>share video on Facebook.</strong></p><h3 id="Method-1-Share-A-Facebook-Friend’s-Video-Post"><a href="#Method-1-Share-A-Facebook-Friend’s-Video-Post" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Share A Facebook Friend’s Video Post"></a>Method 1: Share A Facebook Friend’s Video Post</h3><p>Sharing videos across Facebook initially involves sharing content from a friend’s profile. If your friend has posted a certain video you find attractive, informative, or amusing, you can look to share it across your profile. To carry this out, look into the steps featured below.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log into your Facebook account across any device you seem fit to log in through. Find the video that is to be shared.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/share-videos-to-facebook-1.jpg"                      alt="login with facebook account"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After locating the video, you would find the “Share” button adjacent to the “Like” and “Comment” button. Select the “Share to News Feed” option to lead to a new window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/share-videos-to-facebook-2.jpg"                      alt="tap on share button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You can set up the caption for the post if required. Along with that, you can consider changing the privacy of this post as per your consideration. Once done, tap on “Post” to conclude the sharing process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/share-videos-to-facebook-3.jpg"                      alt="click on post"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Upload-A-New-Post-Onto-Your-Timeline"><a href="#Method-2-Upload-A-New-Post-Onto-Your-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Upload A New Post Onto Your Timeline"></a>Method 2: Upload A New Post Onto Your Timeline</h3><p>While looking to <strong>share video on Facebook</strong> from your friend’s profile, you can also share a certain video from another platform. In other cases, the video can also be something nostalgic from the past which should be shared in your eyes. Thus, you can look to upload a new post across your timeline.

Thus, if you are dealing with them, follow the steps given below for a quick fix:</p><h3 id="How-to-Find-the-Watch-Later-Videos-on-Facebook-3"><a href="#How-to-Find-the-Watch-Later-Videos-on-Facebook-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Find the Watch Later Videos on Facebook?"></a>How to Find the Watch Later Videos on Facebook?</h3><p>Did you know Facebook has a “Watch Later” feature for the desktop version? Yes, you can access this feature for Facebook posts. It appears as a small tab situated at the right side of the uploaded video. Through this feature, you can save a video to watch later. If you do so, the video gets saved in the “Saved” tab. This tab lies on the left side of the News Feed. From there, you can watch the saved item easily. This feature is pretty helpful for those who are in a hurry or cannot watch the video instantly. It’s also easy to access them, whenever you want!</p><h3 id="What-to-Do-If-I-Can’t-View-or-Play-Videos-on-Facebook-3"><a href="#What-to-Do-If-I-Can’t-View-or-Play-Videos-on-Facebook-3" class="headerlink" title="What to Do If I Can’t View or Play Videos on Facebook?"></a>What to Do If I Can’t View or Play Videos on Facebook?</h3><p>One of the most common problems with Facebook is when you want to watch a video but cannot do so. This could occur due to a bad internet connection or technical glitches. The best way to fix these issues is by following the below steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Check If You Have Strong Internet Connection:</strong></li></ul><p>If you have a slow&#x2F;dull internet connection there are chances that your video isn’t playing due to the same. In that case, you can check for a slow connection by opening some other application. If it shows the same issues, switch to a stronger internet connection. Make sure to connect to strong WiFi or cellular data.</p><ul><li><strong>Go for a Quick Application Restart:</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes a quick restart can ensure a swift Facebook video play. So, close the Facebook application on your device and relaunch it. Alternatively, check if there are any recent updates available for the app. If you see any, update the app accordingly.</p><h3 id="How-to-Delete-Watch-History-on-Facebook-3"><a href="#How-to-Delete-Watch-History-on-Facebook-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Delete Watch History on Facebook?"></a>How to Delete Watch History on Facebook?</h3><p>Keep note that your watch history is accessible by you only. However, if you are still skeptical (due to privacy issues), delete the watch history of Facebook. Here’s how you can do so:</p><ul><li>At first, log in to your Facebook account with the credentials (email and password).</li><li>Click on Account&gt;Settings &amp; Privacy.</li><li>Navigate to the Activity Log and then go to the Filter section.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watched-videos-on-facebook-4.jpg"                      alt="delete watch history on facebook"                ></p><ul><li>Within the Categories, look for “Videos you’ve watched.”</li><li>From there, you can delete the videos one-by-one or clear the complete watch history.</li></ul><h3 id="Can-People-See-What-I-Watch-On-Facebook-3"><a href="#Can-People-See-What-I-Watch-On-Facebook-3" class="headerlink" title="Can People See What I Watch On Facebook?"></a>Can People See What I Watch On Facebook?</h3><p>Some people may wonder whether anyone else can see what they watch on Facebook. Fortunately, no. No one can see your watch history. However, they can see the action you perform on the video. Here’s a complete list of what other people can see:</p><ul><li><p>**Page:**If you like or follow a page, your friends may see it once they do the same. For example, if you have liked a page related to a Football team, a friend of yours may see your name in the list of followers&#x2F;likes.</p></li><li><p>**Video Likes:**Your name is visible on the likes of the video if you do the same. Say, if you have liked a video and any friend of yours comes across the post. They may see the term “[Your Name] also liked this.” Similarly, your name is visible when you comment on the video.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watched-videos-on-facebook-5.jpg"                      alt="video likes"                ></p><ul><li>**Post Shares:**Your name is also visible if you share a video to your timeline or in case of direct messages.</li></ul><h3 id="How-Does-Facebook-Decide-the-Suggested-Videos-3"><a href="#How-Does-Facebook-Decide-the-Suggested-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="How Does Facebook Decide the Suggested Videos?"></a>How Does Facebook Decide the Suggested Videos?</h3><p>The videos suggested on Facebook appear because of liked pages and video popularity. You can customize the same through the below steps:</p><ul><li><p>Go to the left menu and click on “Watch” from your News Feed.</p></li><li><p>Click on the right side of the video top and select “Hide Video.” This will ensure you do not see similar videos.</p></li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So, that’s how you can find watched videos on Facebook. The steps are pretty easy and an absolute life-saver. Whenever it feels like you missed a video, these steps will ensure that you find them easily. For your convenience, we have mentioned the process for both the Facebook application and desktop. Make sure to select the method as per the mode you use.

But if you are here on this page then probably you are going to break all rules now and are thinking to jump to Facebook platform with an eye catching profile. That’s a great idea. Facebook is available for free and its interactive user interface will make everything fun for you. I must add, this is the best platform to stay connected with all your near and dear ones.</p><p> So, follow these guidelines to get started with a new Facebook account.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Facebook-Account-4"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Facebook-Account-4" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Facebook Account"></a>How to Create a Facebook Account</h2><h4 id="Step-1-Sign-Up-3"><a href="#Step-1-Sign-Up-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1.Sign Up"></a>Step 1.Sign Up</h4><p> The very first step is to open &lt;<a href="http://www.facebook.com>">www.facebook.com&gt;</a> on your web browser and then hit Create account option. It will ask for your basic information, simple add your real name in the space provided with two fields: First name and Last name. For the security reasons you may have to prove your identity so always prefer to create Facebook account with real name only.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-create-account.jpg"                      alt="facebook create account"                ></p><p> Then enter your accurate and working mobile number or users can also prefer to update their email ID. It will be useful to get updates regarding their facebook account. Up date your desired secure password, birthday details and gender information. Once you enter this information, you will receive a verification code via SMS (if you have entered Mobile Number) or a link in email (if you have entered your email ID). Confirm your identity using this code or email link as your account will be created only after this verification.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Set-up-Privacy-Settings-3"><a href="#Step-2-Set-up-Privacy-Settings-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2.Set up Privacy Settings"></a>Step 2.Set up Privacy Settings</h4><p> As soon as your Facebook account is verified you can move to the next step inside your newly created account.

There are no strings attached to this method. The process is as simple as it can get. The steps include:</p><p>Step 1: For starters, open your Chrome browser and click on three vertical dots located in the top right corner. Click on “Settings” from the context menu that appears.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-2.jpg"                      alt="access chrome settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: The “Settings” will open. Hit “Privacy and Security” and then “Clear Browsing Data.” Select the desired time range and tick mark all options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on clear browsing data"                ></p><p>Step 3: Press “Clear Data,” and you are done.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-4.jpg"                      alt="clear your browser data"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2: Disabling Browser Extensions</strong></p><p>The browser extensions are often added to work effectively.

Thus, it is important to create a video that can force viewers to make quick decision about whether this particular video must be watched or not. In order to leave the best impression on viewer’s mind, every video ad must have two major characteristics: It should not have length more than 20 seconds, content must be capable enough to catch attention within first 2, 3 seconds. Here are few common mistakes for low rating of certain videos ads:</p><ul><li>They have long annoying intro at the beginning.</li><li>Credits or logos are added at beginning portion.</li><li>Sometimes they follow too big story.</li></ul><p> It is good to show your viewers what they are curious to watch, create videos as per the taste of your targeted audience.</p><h4 id="2-Choose-Attractive-Video-Thumbnail"><a href="#2-Choose-Attractive-Video-Thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="2.

The idea is to add a offer that viewers cannot resists and never forget to track links on your video ad using UTM codes as they can help you to know the rating and impact of your video. The best trick is to add an external link to video and somehow compel your audience to move to that external link. It will help your video ads to make unique impact then other competitors.

Thus, it is important to create a video that can force viewers to make quick decision about whether this particular video must be watched or not. In order to leave the best impression on viewer’s mind, every video ad must have two major characteristics: It should not have length more than 20 seconds, content must be capable enough to catch attention within first 2, 3 seconds. Here are few common mistakes for low rating of certain videos ads:</p><ul><li>They have long annoying intro at the beginning.</li><li>Credits or logos are added at beginning portion.</li><li>Sometimes they follow too big story.</li></ul><p> It is good to show your viewers what they are curious to watch, create videos as per the taste of your targeted audience.</p><h4 id="2-Choose-Attractive-Video-Thumbnail-3"><a href="#2-Choose-Attractive-Video-Thumbnail-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

The idea is to add a offer that viewers cannot resists and never forget to track links on your video ad using UTM codes as they can help you to know the rating and impact of your video. The best trick is to add an external link to video and somehow compel your audience to move to that external link. It will help your video ads to make unique impact then other competitors. It is good to add more information to your ad by using headlines for your video, by adding link descriptions and using specially designed call to action triggers.
